19b1760e1f299ab5_2,It’s not a stretch to say Lululemon needed a change,"During a mostly upbeat earnings call on Thursday, Lululemon announced that CEO Calvin McDonald would be stepping down in January, leaving a position he’s held since 2018. Yesterday, investors cheered the news , sending the $100 yoga-pants company’s stock soaring by more than 9%. McDonald’s decision to move on came after more than a year of struggles and pressure from Chip Wilson, Lululemon’s founder and the company’s largest shareholder. Wilson took out a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal in October expressing disapproval of the athleisure maker’s “loss of cool.” It’s a rare instance when a guy’s opinion that more people should be wearing workout clothes is taken seriously. Caught with their pants down Before yesterday’s jump, Lululemon’s stock had dropped ~50% this year. Thursday’s earnings report beat expectations, but the company cut its guidance for a third straight quarter. How did this cultural giant get down so bad so quickly? • American staleness: — While sales were up last quarter, the growth came from outside the US. Revenue has dropped in the US in the past two quarters due to what some believe is a lack of fresh products and Gen Z’s diminishing interest in form-fitting leggings. • Competition: — Other brands offering similar products—or even more innovative ones—at lower prices took a bite out of Lululemon. A perceived lack of coolness and its core customer base entering the workforce and needing to make prudent financial choices didn’t help. • Tariffs: — The company expects to have its full-year profits cut by $210 million due to duties and has been especially hurt by the end of the de minimis exemption . Next up: — CFO Meghan Frank and CCO André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a permanent leader. What’s the fix? — Business of Fashion sees regaining cultural relevance as the main challenge for the next CEO, suggesting brand collabs and edgier marketing that speaks to younger consumers’ preferences in clothing could be the way forward. —DL",2025-12-13 10:53:04
19b1760e1f299ab5_3,Pot stocks got high after reports Trump plans to reclassify marijuana,"Cannabis stocks rallied yesterday after news outlets reported that President Trump plans to ease federal restrictions on marijuana. The Washington Post reported that the president was preparing an executive order that would facilitate moving marijuana from its current Schedule I status, which puts it in the same category as heroin and LSD, to a Schedule III substance, a group that includes Tylenol with codeine and some hormone treatments. Sources told CNBC the order could come Monday. While the change would not legalize weed, it would make it more available for research and allow cannabis companies to get more investment.",2025-12-13 10:53:04
19b1760e1f299ab5_4,Executive order targets state AI laws,"President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that seeks to block AI regulation by individual states, saying it would create a single federal regulatory framework and keep the US at the forefront of the tech. The order authorizes the attorney general to sue over state AI restrictions and tells federal regulators to withhold funds for projects like broadband from states with such laws. The move was controversial, as Republicans had opted against including clauses barring state-level AI rules in recent legislation. And it may not even deter states from moving ahead with their rules, especially because the order is likely to face a court challenge.",2025-12-13 10:53:04
19b1760e1f299ab5_5,Former Michigan football coach charged with crimes after firing,"Ex-University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore was arraigned on three charges yesterday for crimes allegedly committed hours after the school fired him. Prosecutors charged Moore with felony third-degree home invasion, as well as stalking in a domestic relationship and breaking and entering, both misdemeanors. The university said Moore was fired because of his relationship with a woman who also worked for the school, and at the time he was fired, Moore had nearly $12.3 million remaining on his contract, according to ESPN. Prosecutors claim that after being terminated, he “barged his way” into the apartment of the woman — with whom he had been involved for “a number of years” before she broke up with him and informed the school, prompting his dismissal — and threatened to kill himself. —AR",2025-12-13 10:53:04
19b1760e1f299ab5_6,Appetizers boom in worrying sign for the economy,"A new semi-scientific recession indicator just dropped: surging appetizer sales. Restaurant-goers are loading up on apps like there’s no tomorrow, CNBC reported this week, based on data from Buyers Edge Platform, a company that helps eateries source ingredients. Mozz stick index Buyers Edge attributes what it dubbed the “appetizer economy” to budget-conscious eaters forgoing pricey entrees and dessert and opting instead for finger foods that often come with promotions and drink specials: • Sales of mozzarella sticks, pickle chips, and cheese curds—dishes notorious for denting the appetite for the main course—are up by about a third in 2025 compared to last year. • Meanwhile, dessert orders dropped 2% over the same period. The Great Appetizer Awakening comes as Americans increasingly feel the bite of inflation when eating out. The price of a meal at a full-service restaurant was up 4.2% in September compared to a year before, according to government data. Big picture: — The trend fits into the so-called K-shaped economy, in which wealthier people continue to spend, while lower-income consumers tighten their belts. For instance, the New York Times recently reported that online pizza orders have declined , while Papa John’s customers are opting for smaller pies and fewer toppings. Sagging sales are potentially caused by the proliferation of competing options on delivery apps and weight loss drugs—but are also a sign that many diners might be struggling to afford even relatively inexpensive indulgences. —SK",2025-12-13 10:53:04

19b122dd32ca4848_2,Disney lets OpenAI use its characters in AI videos,"You can soon make Bart Simpson ding-dong ditch the elderly gentleman from Up without prompting a copyright lawsuit, thanks to Disney licensing its IP to OpenAI yesterday in a deal that is likely to make Hollywood jittery. The Mouse House plugged the ChatGPT-maker with a $1 billion equity investment and allowed for more than 200 of its characters—including Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar creations—to guest star in user-prompted AI clips on OpenAI’s Sora app. The three-year agreement only covers animated or illustrated Disney imagery, meaning the faces and voices of Disney’s human talent aren’t greenlit for Sorafication. What’s in it for Disney? • A source told The Wall Street Journal that OpenAI will pay Disney for using its characters, which it promised to protect from fanfic fiends non-kid-friendly use. A selection of Sora videos will also appear on Disney+. • Disney CEO Bob Iger said that allowing Sora users to play with its fictional beings will “thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach” of its storytelling. Industry observers say that the deal allows the entertainment behemoth to assert control over AI versions of its characters, which have been appearing in videos without permission anyways. It makes Disney the first major studio to let Sora use its output and marks a historic foray into AI for an entertainment giant that famously protects its IP like Scrooge McDuck guards his gold. Meanwhile, OpenAI rivals hear from Disney lawyers A day before revealing Mickey is now fair game for Sora, Disney penned a cease-and-desist letter to Google, claiming the company’s AI tools spit out content that incorporates its IP without permission. Disney recently expressed similar copyright concerns in a cease-and-desist letter to Character.AI.

19b122dd32ca4848_6,Oracle stock nosedives amid AI fears,"The open bar at Oracle’s holiday party is going to hit a little differently after Wednesday’s earnings report. The company’s stock plummeted almost 11% yesterday, shaving over $100 billion from its market cap, as investors nervously eyed its outsized reliance on the AI industry and its accompanying spending. The cloud-computing company not only missed Wall Street’s quarterly revenue expectations, it also bumped up its full-year capital expenditure forecast from $35 billion to $50 billion. And most of that spending is on building out more AI-related infrastructure. • That increased spend is equal to 75% of Oracle’s expected revenue for this year. Historically, its capex (the money that a company spends on long term assets) is about 17% of its total revenue. • Oracle is already sitting on $106 billion in debt, and Morgan Stanley analysts predict that will grow to $290 billion in the next three years. Oracle has benefited from investors’ AI enthusiasm with its stock rising after it inked big cloud computing contracts with OpenAI and others. Now investors fear Oracle is biting off a bit more than it can chew—especially with OpenAI facing heat from deep-pocketed rivals—though it’s still up by about 20% for the year even with yesterday’s plunge.

JetBlue referred to the space as an NYC-inspired “home away from home,” because surely everyone’s Big Apple apartment also has: • Two floors, each with their own bar. • A library corner and game room. • Ceiling artwork resembling Grand Central Terminal’s famous mural. • A neon sign above the toilet that says “Live, Laugh, Lav.” BlueHouse will accommodate an intimate 140 travelers to avoid the overcrowding issues plaguing other airport lounges. To qualify, you need to either 1) buy premium seats on flights to Europe, 2) carry JetBlue’s Premier World Elite Mastercard ($499), or 3) spend $25,000 annually on JetBlue travel, which lands you in its top loyalty tier.

19b0d1567e06ae6a_2,A divided Fed delivers its last rate cut of the year,"It’s so confusing sometimes to be the Fed. Caught in an internal tug-of-war over the risks of higher inflation and lower employment, the US central bank voted yesterday to reduce interest rates for the third straight time this year, lowering them by a quarter point to bring the range down to between 3.5% and 3.75%. It might be the last cut for a while: “We’re well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. This suggests that the Fed may hold borrowing costs steady unless the labor market weakens further, which wouldn’t be clear until economic data resumes its regularly scheduled programming following months of disruption from the government shutdown. Fed in disarray: — For the first time since 2019, one quarter of the rate-setting committee voted against yesterday’s cut—two members wanted to keep rates unchanged, while newbie Stephen Miran once again called for a bigger reduction. Unlike a dinner bill or a banana… The Fed is rarely so split. This year is different: Rate-setting decisions haven’t been unanimous since June, as committee members disagree over which beast is currently hairier—inflation or jobs. Lower interest rates tend to boost employment while risking inflation, whereas higher interest rates tend to tamp down consumer prices while risking harm to the labor market. It’s quite the pickle when neither area is in great shape: • Annual inflation sat at 2.8% in September, below Wall Street’s expectations but well above the Fed’s 2% goal, according to the most recently available reading of the Fed’s preferred gauge. Tariffs are playing a part in rising prices, but not as much as economists feared. • Despite a spurt of job growth in September, unemployment hit a four-year high of 4.4% that month, according to government data. Looking ahead… — Fed officials project one rate cut next year, but you never know with this bunch, especially right now. President Trump is close to naming a new Fed Chair to succeed Powell after his term expires in May. —ML",2025-12-11 10:53:00

19b0d1567e06ae6a_6,Elon Musk reportedly eyes $1 trillion SpaceX IPO,"SpaceX is prepping an IPO for next year that would put the company in rarified air, according to various reports. CEO Elon Musk is looking to raise at least $30 billion to take the rocket and satellite manufacturer public at a $1.5 trillion valuation, per Bloomberg. Sources gave Reuters more modest numbers, reporting that SpaceX wants to raise $25 billion at a $1 trillion valuation. But if SpaceX secures $30 billion, it would mark the largest IPO in history, eclipsing the $29 billion raised by Saudi Aramco in its 2019 listing, while pushing Musk’s net worth to nearly $1 trillion. The era of centicorns Other private companies valued at $100 billion or more, like OpenAI and Anthropic, will be watching the response to SpaceX’s potential IPO closely: • OpenAI—the only private startup with a higher reported valuation than SpaceX—and Anthropic have already set IPO plans in motion, possibly for next year. • Both AI giants are projecting at least $20 billion in revenue for 2026—roughly the same as SpaceX’s projected revenue in 2026. Zoom out: — If there’s appetite for SpaceX stock, that could make the $2.9 trillion in private companies more inclined to go public following several slow years for the IPO market, according to Bloomberg. —DL",2025-12-11 10:53:00
19b0d1567e06ae6a_7,US officials encourage airports to build mini-gyms,"As if dragging a three-wheeled carry-on across the mileage of an international airport isn’t enough, the government wants you panting before your flight. This week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had a pull-up competition in the middle of Reagan National Airport’s Terminal 2 (not a metaphor) to announce the $1 billion in grants the administration plans to allocate toward healthy airport upgrades. • Officials were vague about what these upgrades could include, but mentioned projects like dedicated play areas for kids, more lactation pods, and mini-gyms for travelers. • The funding will come from former President Biden’s 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and is part of the current administration’s “Make Travel Family Friendly Again” initiative. But… — over 30 major US airport hubs already have children’s play areas, and most airports have been required to provide private lactation areas since FY2021. And 68% of passengers said their top priority for air travel changes is lower prices, according to a 2025 Ipsos poll for Airlines for America. Big picture: — The administration has been pushing initiatives to make flying more pleasant.

A new study from the University of Cambridge found that while humans aren’t quite as true to our partners as Eurasian beavers, we are more likely to exhibit fidelity than meerkats. The study analyzed data from animals and self-reporting from humans to compare the percentages of full siblings versus half siblings, and ranked 35 species for their faithfulness: • Humans came in at No. 7, with 66% of siblings sharing both parents. • That puts us behind creatures like the California deermouse (100%), the African wild dog (85%), the Damaraland mole rat (79.5%), the moustached tamarin (77.6%), the Ethiopian wolf (76.5%), and the Eurasian beaver (72.9%), but ahead of the rest of the top ten: the white-handed gibbon (63.5%), the meerkat (59.9%), the grey wolf (46.2%), and the red fox (45.2%). • And we’re lapping our close relatives mountain gorillas (6%), as well as chimpanzees and dolphins (4%). The evolutionary anthropologist who led the study, Mark Dyble, told the Washington Post that “the data suggest that we are” a monogamous species—and how surprising that is depends on your own assumptions. —AR",2025-12-11 10:53:00

After a year of wondering if Aussie officials would go through with it, social media companies will now have to shut down over 1 million accounts as the rest of the world watches. The ban, aimed at protecting kids from what officials say are highly addictive platforms, will affect the nearly 86% of Australians between the ages of eight and 15 who used social media in the country, according to the Australian government. Social media companies—including Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, X, Reddit, Kick, Twitch, and Facebook—are now required to institute age verification or face a fine of up to ~$32 million for repeated offenses: • Social media platforms must now have age verification systems in place. The systems range from asking users to submit live video selfies or official documents to verifying via email. • Reports are already surfacing of the verification systems incorrectly identifying teens’ ages, and of users illegally evading the ban with VPNs. The ban is popular A 2024 YouGov poll found that 77% of Australians supported the ban, with proponents arguing it will decrease cyberbullying and help protect children’s mental health. Meanwhile, platform execs, free speech advocates, some parents, and young people claim the ban will jeopardize privacy and push kids to even more dangerous parts of the internet. Two 15-year-old Australians are pursuing a legal challenge, saying it unconstitutionally silences young people.

Challenging those caps is a group of Republicans that includes Vice President JD Vance, who was an Ohio Senate candidate when the dispute began. Experts say that allowing unlimited spending by parties would likely benefit Republicans, as it would neutralize Democrats’ long-standing advantage with small-dollar contributions. That could save the GOP “tens of millions” during next year’s midterms, per the New York Times. A ruling is expected by July.",2025-12-10 10:39:01

Zelensky opposes ceding territory to Russia and said Ukraine is ready to present the US with a new proposal.

19b07e01f71679c2_6,Ford collabs with Renault in ‘fight for our lives’,"Like a tourist treating locals to beers in exchange for under-the-radar recs, Ford tapped France’s Renault to help it win back Europeans navigating narrow cobbled roads. The two automakers announced yesterday that they’re teaming up to bring affordable and small Ford-branded EVs to European dealerships starting in 2028, amid what Ford CEO Jim Farley said was “a fight for our lives” against Chinese competitors. Ford fumbles The Detroit automaker’s blue oval has become a rarer sight on Europe’s streets than cafes serving iced coffee: • Ford has lost more than half of its passenger car market share on the Continent in the last decade, falling from 7.2% in 2015 to 3.3% this year (through October). • Meanwhile, Chinese automakers like BYD and SAIC Motor wooed Europeans with cheap rides stuffed with digital features, commanding 6.7% of the market in Q3. Sagging sales have led Ford to announce cuts of 5,000 jobs at its German plant beginning in 2024. Renault to the rescue Ford is banking that infusing Renault-engineered compact EVs with Ford’s design and driving dynamics know-how, will help it stave off Chinese competition as well as European rivals like Volkswagen. Beyond petite passenger cars… — the two companies will consider co-producing commercial vans, which are Ford’s bread and butter in Europe. —SK",2025-12-10 10:39:01

The methodology: — In September, Consumer Reports and the progressive think tank Groundwork Collaborative used ~200 volunteers to check prices on 20 items in four cities. The volunteers simultaneously chose the same product from the same store and found price differences in ~75% of items. Costco, Kroger, Safeway, and Target were among the retailers included. The price is not right for everyone • Instacart uses pricing tools from Eversight, an AI company it purchased in 2022, that can create as much as a 23% increase in prices for customers and 2%–5% jump in profit for stores, according to CR. • Experts told CR that Instacart was testing customers’ price sensitivity. This was confirmed when an email between Instacart and Costco that called the practice “smart rounding” was accidentally sent to CR by Costco. Shop of horrors: — This type of dynamic pricing, which has proliferated in the age of AI, can contribute to steeper costs, according to an academic paper released this year. And Instacart is all in on AI: The company and OpenAI just announced a partnership that will allow customers to cook up recipes in ChatGPT and pay for groceries without leaving the chat interface. —DL",2025-12-10 10:39:01
19b07e01f71679c2_8,Prime number: The growing “ambition gap”,"Twelve years after former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg published Lean In , women appear to be leaning out at the workplace. For the first time, women are now less interested than men in getting promoted, according to a new report from McKinsey and LeanIn.org. The so-called “ ambition gap ” shows up at every career stage: • 69% of entry-level women want a promotion vs. 80% of entry-level men • 82% of mid-career women want a promotion vs. 86% of mid-career men • 84% of senior executive women want a promotion vs. 92% of senior executive men Per the report, the gap is not because women are any less ambitious—it’s because they’re receiving less support. The decline of DEI programs, combined with the rise of return-to-office mandates, has limited opportunities for their career development. “Corporate America is signaling that they’re kind of rolling back their commitment to women, and women themselves are signaling that they’re feeling it,” LeanIn CEO Rachel Thomas told Bloomberg. “Together, that’s a recipe for disaster.” —AE",2025-12-10 10:39:01

19b02c75387d580d_2,Hostile territory: Paramount makes a bid for WBD,"Leave it to a merger between entertainment companies to have drama. Paramount Skydance launched an all-cash $108 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery yesterday, three days after Netflix announced a deal to buy WBD for $82.7 billion. “We’re really here to finish what we started,” Paramount CEO David Ellison told CNBC, referencing the six bids his company made before Netflix’s offer was accepted, and making sure his words were as hostile as the takeover bid itself. Paramount is relying on more money for shareholders and what it sees as a more straightforward path to a green light from regulators to bolster its bid: • Paramount’s offer is $30 per share in cash, and could reportedly go higher. Netflix made its deal at $27.75 per share in cash and stock. • While Netflix only wants WBD’s streaming and studio businesses, Paramount wants it all. The path to Hollywood runs through Washington No matter which bid ultimately triumphs, a deal can only close if antitrust regulators sign off. The Netflix deal was already facing scrutiny, with President Trump saying Sunday that Netflix’s large market share “could be a problem.” Paramount is perceived as more likely to get the nod. That’s partly because it lacks Netflix’s streaming dominance and partly because of who’s involved: • Some of Paramount’s funding comes from Affinity Partners, an investment firm started by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar have also kicked in $24 billion, per Bloomberg—but they and Kushner would forgo any board voting rights, which could help push the deal through. • Meanwhile, Ellison is the son of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, an ally of Trump. Market reaction: — Netflix shares dropped more than 3% yesterday, while Paramount shot up 9%. But… — Paramount’s perceived pandering may be having the opposite effect. Semafor reports some officials in DC have expressed frustration at the notion that the Justice Department would favor the Ellison family. —DL",2025-12-09 10:52:34

19b02c75387d580d_6,SCOTUS considers expanding presidential firing power,"The Supreme Court heard arguments yesterday in a momentous case that’ll decide to whom the president can say “you’re fired!” The case directly concerns President Trump’s removal of Democratic Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter over policy differences, but the verdict will determine the president’s power over dozens of independent government agencies. SCOTUS already opted to let Slaughter’s sacking stand until it issues a ruling in her suit challenging the firing. And now, the court seems likely to make the removal permanent, as the Conservative justices appeared receptive to the administration’s arguments that presidents can’t exercise their full constitutional powers without the ability to remove agency leaders. The justices permanently green-lighting the firing would overturn a 1935 landmark ruling known as Humphrey’s Executor, which allowed Congress to limit the president’s authority to dismiss leaders of independent federal agencies. The precedent’s proponents argue that it ensures that government regulators are led by bipartisan boards of experts, rather than party loyalists. Who could get the boot? A Trump win would enable future firings across the government, including at agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But… — it likely won’t affect Fed bosses, as the court indicated that the central bank might be exempt from the same level of presidential control as other agencies.

19b02c75387d580d_7,China’s exports notch $1t record despite US tariffs,"One of the main targets of President Trump’s trade war had other toys to play with in timeout: China’s annual trade surplus surpassed $1 trillion for the first time this year as it ramped up exports of semiconductors and vehicles to pretty much everyone but the US, China’s customs agency announced yesterday. The country hit the milestone last month, making its trade surplus for the first 11 months of the year nearly 10% higher than its 2024 total. In November: • China’s total exports climbed 5.9% from the same time last year despite a 29% plunge in US-bound shipments, the eighth straight month of double-digit declines. • Other trading partners more than made up for the loss of some money from the US. Chinese exports to the EU grew by 15%—the most they’ve grown in more than three years—and goods shipped to Africa and Southeast Asia climbed by 28% and 8.4%, respectively. Multi-edged sword: — China’s export boom is powered by its weak currency, which makes its products more affordable abroad but constrains Chinese consumers’ purchasing power. The country’s economic growth relies heavily on foreign demand, which it’s struggling to change. Meanwhile, threatened by China’s growing export dominance, France is considering imposing tariffs if China doesn’t narrow its French trade surplus. —ML",2025-12-09 10:52:34

19afd8650dd47cfd_2,Things are going bananas at Apple,"It might be time for Apple to think different. The tech giant is losing talent, seemingly falling behind in the AI race, and getting unsolicited feedback from Justin Bieber. But the biggest issue driving it all may be that CEO Tim Cook is losing his sous chefs left and right. In the last week alone, Apple announced four of his direct reports would be leaving the company: • Alan Dye, VP of interface design, is joining rival Meta. • General Counsel Kate Adams is retiring next year. • Lisa Jackson, VP of environment, policy, and social initiatives, is also retiring next year. • Aaand AI chief John Giannandrea is…retiring next year. That’s a lot of volatility for a C-suite that has only had two chief executives since 1997 (Cook and Steve Jobs). It may get worse: — Bloomberg reports that Johny Srouji, the senior VP of hardware tech, who runs Apple’s in-house chips effort, has also told Cook he’s considering a change of scenery , though Apple is trying to figure out a way to keep him around. AI is costing jobs…with a twist Giannandrea, the AI chief, was pushed out after Apple struggled to leverage its hardware advantages into Siri (let alone Apple Intelligence) dominance, ceding the chatbot lead to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Researchers and engineers have also been jumping ship, joining Meta, OpenAI, and several AI startups, taking an even bigger bite out of Apple’s AI push. Will Apple keep letting Tim cook? — The CEO just turned 65, but he isn’t expected to step down anytime soon. He’s expressed (probably sincere) optimism about the company’s upcoming product lineup. But industry watchers are having some doubts. Prediction markets anticipate about a 50-50 shot that Cook is still the CEO by the end of 2026.— BC",2025-12-08 10:24:26

While some locals see it as a sign of hope for the community, others dispute the milestone.

The Louvre’s deputy general administrator said that flooding last week led to a pipe bursting in one of the rooms of the Egyptian antiquities department’s library, soaking 300 to 400 books, visual periodicals, archaeology journals, and other works, some of which date back to the 1800s. A complete count of affected items is being conducted, and museum staff are attempting to dry and dehumidify them. A major renovation of the Louvre’s HVAC had been planned beginning in September 2026 including the area of the museum affected by the damaged pipe. Didier Rykner, a French art historian, wrote in La Tribune de l’Art that the antiquities department had repeatedly asked the deputy general administrator for funds “to protect these books from a potential rupture of the pipes running through the false ceilings, whose state of dilapidation is well known.”— HVL",2025-12-08 10:24:26
19afd8650dd47cfd_6,Kei cars for a K-shaped economy?,"On Friday, President Trump posted to Truth Social, “I have just approved TINY CARS to be built in America.” He was referring to kei cars, which he said last week might solve the auto affordability crisis in America. Market watchers aren’t so sure. What exactly is a kei car? Pronounced like “kay,” they can actually be cars, trucks, or vans. It’s a vehicle category in Japan for autos that are at most ~11 feet long, ~4.9 feet wide, and ~6.6 feet tall. By comparison, the last gas-powered Smart Car that was sold new in the US before Mercedes-Benz stopped offering them stateside is too big and powerful to be considered a kei car in Japan, according to Car and Driver. Due to their small size, kei cars don’t meet current US safety standards, and changes to the vehicles and the regulations would be needed. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNBC that kei cars are “probably not” for anyone who wants to drive on a freeway, but “ if there’s a market for those vehicles, I want to give our manufacturers the opportunity to build those cars.” Big picture: — “The auto market in the United States is going toward bigger, more luxurious cars,” David Friedman, the former acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told the New York Times. It’s not clear that automakers want to make vehicles that cost $10,000 brand-new.— HVL",2025-12-08 10:24:26

Not all policymakers are sold on lowering rates, especially since the data picture is still fuzzy following the government shutdown. Investors will also watch for any clues about what the central bank might do when it meets again at the end of January. SCOTUS hears arguments today on Trump’s firing of an FTC regulator: — In March, President Trump fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission’s board, Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Both sued, arguing that Trump’s actions violated legal precedent. Bedoya later dropped his suit, but Slaughter stuck with the case as appeals courts offered up conflicting rulings until it reached the Supreme Court. The case could reshape presidential authority over federal agencies. It’s one of several cases that the high court’s justices will hear regarding the extent of presidential power this term. Who will win college football’s most prestigious award? — Besides being the easiest award to high-five, the Heisman Trophy recognizes college football’s top player.

At Art Basel 2025 in Miami—which in past years brought us banana taped to wall and the ATM leaderboard —the artist most associated with NFTs brought flesh-colored robo dogs adorned with the heads of famous artists and tech titans for a project called “Regular Animals.” According to the Wall Street Journal , Beeple made two dogs each to resemble himself, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Andy Warhol, Elon Musk, and Pablo Picasso. (Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, said he’s also keeping an “artist’s proof” of each version.) Oh, and the dogs kind of poop NFTs: • Beeple said of his choice of human inspos, “Increasingly our worldview is being reshaped by tech giants, specifically Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who control powerful algorithms. They decide what we see and what we don’t see. I also wanted to put the idea forward that we are increasingly seeing the world through the lens of AI.” • He did that by outfitting the chest of each dog with a camera so that it walks around snapping photos. Those images then go through AI filters before some of them “print” from the dogs’ rear ends. • They were expected to produce around 1,000 prints over the course of the art fair, which wrapped yesterday. “Around 256” of them were to include QR codes that could be redeemed for an NFT of the image, according to Beeple. The dogs were priced at $100,000 each and completely sold out. Beeple’s NFT collage “Everydays: the First 5,000 Days” sold at Christie’s in 2021 for $69.3 million, breaking the record for any digital art, before the non-fungible token market largely collapsed starting in 2022.

And the world might be next. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced yesterday that Netflix agreed to acquire WBD’s streaming and studio businesses for $82.7 billion , beating out Paramount Skydance and Comcast in a heated bidding war. If approved by regulators, the deal would reshape Hollywood and complete Netflix’s transformation into the most dominant force in entertainment. What Netflix is (and isn’t) buying Here’s what the streaming giant is getting: • The Warner Bros. film studio — . That means Netflix would own IP like Harry Potter and could add Batman into Bridgerton if it wanted to. • HBO — . Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos once said the company aimed “to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.” He meant that literally. The deal would give Netflix control of TV’s most prestigious brand, along with properties like Game of Thrones and The White Lotus . • HBO Max. — It’s unclear if Netflix will absorb HBO Max or keep it as a separate streaming service. Either way, it may have to change its name for the umpteenth time. And here’s what Netflix isn’t buying: • WBD’s cable TV channels. — New-school Netflix wants nothing to do with WBD’s old-school linear TV business, which includes CNN and TNT. Those networks and others will be spun off as a standalone company in 2026. • Hollywood’s respect. — A-listers are freaking out about what Netflix’s conquest means for the film industry. Which brings us to… Are theaters dead? — Not necessarily, but observers are worried. The historically theater-averse Netflix claims it will continue to release Warner Bros. movies in cinemas, but hasn’t said how long (or how often) it will keep them there. What now? — Netflix expects the deal to close next year, but it will face an uphill battle for regulators’ approval. On top of the obvious antitrust questions, the Trump administration is widely believed to have favored Paramount’s bid, and reportedly views Netflix’s victory with “ heavy skepticism .” —AE",2025-12-06 10:52:24

In place of the universal guidance offered since 1991, the panel said families in which the mother does not test positive for the liver disease can opt to wait two months before the first dose.

Three years, some check mark updates, and one name change later, X got fined $140 million by the EU yesterday for violating the bloc’s transparency rules for online platforms—and US officials are not amused. This is the first penalty issued under Europe’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which was adopted in 2022, to Big Tech’s dismay. European officials claim X violated the law in three ways, saying: • X’s blue check mark system—which signifies an X Premium subscription, not identity verification—is “deceptive” puts users at risk of scams, impersonation fraud, and manipulation. • The company’s ad history database lacks key information, like who paid for an ad. Requests for access are met with “excessive delays.” • X also prohibits independent researchers from accessing its public data, “undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union.” X and Musk haven’t commented publicly yet, but previously said they’d challenge any fine. White House unhappy. — Ahead of the EU’s decision, US Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “The EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage.” European regulators are also probing Apple, Google, and Meta for DSA violations.

19aee20b3faec49e_2,Zuck finally stops trying to make metaverse happen,"We’re starting a petition to bring back “The Facebook” now that “Meta” might become obsolete: After struggling for years to get you to care about virtual worlds, Mark Zuckerberg will slash the resources devoted to his metaverse dreams, likely in order to go full throttle on AI, Bloomberg reported yesterday. According to the publication: • Meta plans to cut its metaverse budget by as much as 30% next year, with layoffs expected as early as January. • The cuts will target the teams that work on Quest virtual-reality headsets and Meta Horizon Worlds, an immersive online space originally with Nintendo-Wii-Mii-like graphics that got more traction as a meme than a product. “The metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet,” — Zuck said in 2021, when announcing Facebook’s rebrand as a VR-focused company called Meta. So much for that: Horizon Worlds was a “ deserted fantasyland ” by early 2023, New York Magazine declared. Meanwhile, Reality Labs—Meta’s division for metaverse work—has bled more than $70 billion since 2021, according to Bloomberg. Investors are overjoyed Meta’s stock rose more than 3% yesterday, adding tens of billions of dollars to its market cap as a reward for Zuck finally listening to the chorus of boos surrounding his costly project. Analysts and investors long viewed the metaverse as a financial lead balloon, and watchdogs saw it as a Wild West for child safety. Like you when you abandon your New Year’s resolution, — Zuck pretty much stopped talking about the metaverse in public statements and on earnings calls. Meta already laid off more than 100 Reality Labs employees earlier this year. Looking ahead… — slashing metaverse operations is expected to give Meta more room to focus on AI, especially after its latest chatbot, Llama 4, underwhelmed users. The company’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, however, are gaining momentum in wearable mixed-reality tech, where Apple, Google, and Snapchat have so far failed. —ML",2025-12-05 10:38:40

19aee20b3faec49e_6,NYT sued the Pentagon over new press policy,"The Grey Lady is taking the five-sided building to federal court. The New York Times sued the Pentagon and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth yesterday over his department's recently rolled out press policy—which major news outlets, including the NYT, refused to follow, getting them booted from Pentagon premises. The newspaper argues that the Pentagon’s media rules violate the First Amendment, while flouting due process guarantees with potential for arbitrary enforcement and no option to appeal press badge revocations. Press vs. Pentagon In October, the Pentagon asked news outlets to sign on to the new media policy, which it said was crafted to protect servicemembers. The policy forbade reporters from asking Defense Department sources for info that Pentagon officials hadn’t authorized for publication, and barred them from accessing parts of the building unaccompanied. Thirty outlets, including the NYT, the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and Newsmax surrendered their press badges instead of signing on. Now, the Times is asking a judge to declare the policy unconstitutional and to order the Pentagon to let its reporters back inside. In the meantime… — many news organizations are covering the Pentagon without entering it, while the Defense Department recently welcomed a new press corps consisting mostly of digital media outlets friendly to the Trump administration. —SK",2025-12-05 10:38:40

It’s big. — FIFA expanded next year’s World Cup tournament—set to take place in June in the US, Canada, and Mexico—from the usual 32 nations to 48. And because six spots won’t be finalized until the end of March, there will technically be a record 64 teams included in today’s draw. Here’s how it works: • Each team has already been placed into one of four pots based on their FIFA ranking. • A ball, each corresponding to a specific country, is drawn live to determine which group each team will be placed in. Countries will play the other three teams in their group to determine who advances to a knockout-style “Round of 32.” • This year’s system was tweaked so that, for the first time, the top four teams (Spain, Argentina, France, and England) can’t play each other until the semifinals. There are political undertones. — The draw, which is always a big shebang, may be even more dramatic this year with President Trump in attendance at the Kennedy Center, the iconic cultural center of which he is now the chairman. FIFA will also likely award him its first-ever Peace Prize after FIFA President Gianni Infantino complained that Trump was snubbed for the Nobel Peace Prize earlier this year.— MM",2025-12-05 10:38:40

19ae90752f4d9cc9_2,"Small businesses shrank, surprising jobs report says","The job market says “nvm, it’s not all good.” The US private sector shed 32,000 jobs in November after adding an upward-revised 47,000 jobs the month before, according to a report released yesterday by the payroll firm ADP. The losses, led by small businesses , amounted to America’s largest private headcount dip since early 2023. ADP’s jobs numbers—which have basked in the limelight lately as a stand-in for government data that’s been missing because of the recent shutdown—blindsided analysts who predicted that America would gain several thousand jobs. The government’s November jobs report, which is slated to be released on Dec. 16, following a delay (and after the Fed meets next week), should provide a more complete picture of what’s up with America’s cubicles. But for now, we know that mom-and-pop establishments dragged down recent employment stats: • Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed 120,000 workers. • Larger companies with 50+ workers actually expanded their headcount by a cumulative 90,000—but their job growth still slowed from previous months. Not all industries shrank staff: — Manufacturing, construction, information, finance, and business and professional services reduced headcount. Meanwhile, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and natural resources and mining grew payrolls. Why’d the jobs vanish? Some economists say the hiring rut likely stems from consumer belt-tightening amid economic challenges, while a survey of manufacturers released this week found that some companies are slowing hiring due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariff policy. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that tariffs are unrelated to the anemic hiring, instead blaming the government shutdown for squeezing small businesses. He said that the administration’s deportation ramp-up also played a role, but predicted that employment trends would soon rebound. What is certain is that… — the tough job market snapshot will give ammo to Fed officials advocating for a deeper rate cut next week amid divisions at the central bank over how aggressively to lower borrowing costs.

19ae90752f4d9cc9_3,Trump’s immigration crackdown comes to New Orleans and Minnesota,"Federal agents arrived in New Orleans yesterday and began an immigration enforcement operation that the Department of Homeland Security said would focus on people who are in the country without authorization and have a criminal history. But many people detained in past sweeps have not had criminal records, according to federal officials, and immigrants in the city told news outlets they were fearful of leaving their homes. New Orleans is the latest Democrat-run locale to be targeted, and, as in other cities, there have been protests in response. An operation was also launched in Minnesota, a day after President Trump went on a tirade against the state’s Somali population during a Cabinet meeting, saying, “I don’t want them in our country.”",2025-12-04 10:52:12
19ae90752f4d9cc9_4,Watchdog reportedly finds Hegseth could have endangered troops with Signal chat,"The Pentagon’s inspector general’s report on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of Signal to discuss a forthcoming military strike in Yemen said it could have put troops and their mission at risk—but also found that Hegseth had the power to declassify the information disclosed in the chat, sources who’d seen the findings told the Associated Press yesterday. The report is also said to note that Hegseth violated Pentagon policy by using a personal device for official business. The Signal use became public after an editor from The Atlantic was accidentally included in a chat. The report comes as Hegseth faces scrutiny from lawmakers over a second strike that killed the survivors of a previous attack on an alleged drug boat.",2025-12-04 10:52:12
19ae90752f4d9cc9_5,Trump admin to roll back car fuel-efficiency standards,"With executives from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis in attendance, President Trump announced plans to weaken Biden-era fuel economy standards that were intended to help boost electric cars. Under newly proposed Department of Transportation rules, most cars would need to achieve 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, down from the 50 miles per gallon standard adopted under former President Biden. The DOT said the proposal would save Americans $109 billion over the next five years, while critics say the change will encourage automakers to continue to focus on environmentally unfriendly vehicles that could ultimately cost consumers more at the gas pump. —AR",2025-12-04 10:52:12
19ae90752f4d9cc9_6,What’s Bending Spoons and why’s it buying everything?,"Eventbrite, the events and ticketing site that has an email sitting in your spam folder right now, is being acquired for $500 million by an Italian company you’ve probably never heard of: Bending Spoons. The site will join the Milan-based software conglomerate’s recognizable portfolio of stalled tech companies, like Evernote and WeTransfer, while its acquisitions of Vimeo and AOL are expected to close soon. Who are these mysterious Italians scooping up ancient internet legends? — Bending Spoons was born 12 years ago after the founders of a failed scrapbooking app pivoted to acquiring digital businesses and completely rebuilding them. The company buys flailing subscription-based platforms at a fraction of their previous valuations. Eventbrite, for instance, was valued at $1.76 billion after its IPO in 2018. The Bending Spoons playbook typically includes laying off huge swaths of employees and quickly rebuilding everything, from coding to product pricing. But Bending Spoons doesn’t seem to be in it for a quick buck—the company invests in long-term growth, aiming “to hold forever.” It has yet to sell any of its acquisitions. Big picture: — So far, the strategy appears to be boosting the value of Bending Spoons itself. Its most recent funding round of $710 million in October valued the company at $11 billion.— MM",2025-12-04 10:52:12
19ae90752f4d9cc9_7,Spotify Wrapped has a new age feature that’s not AI,"One year after a rare record scratch, Spotify brought back an old favorite and included new features people actually like with the 2025 edition of Wrapped, which arrived yesterday. After many users complained about 2024’s offering on social media, Spotify executives said they used that disappointment to fuel this year’s update to its highly anticipated year in review data dump: • Top genres returned after an inexplicable absence last year. • New features include top albums and audiobooks, playcounts for your top songs, a game where you guess your top song, and a “Wrapped Party” on the app that’s a “live competition you can play with friends.” • Then there’s the potentially crushing reveal of your “listening age” based on your data. Our Executive Editor Neal Freyman’s was 92, which was only slightly older than we guessed. Out with AI (but not entirely): — Spotify received blowback in 2024 for going all-in on AI at the last minute. This year, the only celebration of AI is Listening Archive, which pinpoints trends from specific days (i.e., reminding you of the sad song you played 100 times when you were dumped on Feb. 14). Like and subscribe: — Wrapped is more than just something to share on your socials. During a Q4 earnings call, Co-president Alex Norstrom said Wrapped has “become a significant driver of our business.” It engaged 245 million users last year. —DL",2025-12-04 10:52:12
19ae90752f4d9cc9_8,Prime number: A $200m shutdown hit,"Congressional staffers may be back to eating Sweetgreen at their desks and paychecks for federal workers are flowing again, but businesses are still navigating the fallout from the longest-ever US government shutdown, which ended last month. Airlines experienced some of the most turbulence from the shutdown, and Delta said yesterday it expects a $200 million hit to its bottom line. • To ease the strain on air traffic controllers who weren’t collecting pay during the 43-day shutdown, regulators restricted traffic at 40 major airports across the country, forcing airlines to cancel flights. Delta’s CEO previously said the airline had to nix 2,000+ of them, per Bloomberg. • The $200 million ding to its fourth-quarter profits will hit its earnings by ~$0.25 per share, Delta said. But don’t feel too bad for the airline your AmEx-wielding friend insists on using for every trip, as Delta said demand for flights is looking robust through the end of the year and into 2026. Though booking growth flagged during the shutdown, it has since picked back up for the carrier. —AR",2025-12-04 10:52:12

19ae3d429807e153_2,Altman orders OpenAI ‘code red’ as rivals grow,"Just as everyone else begins to slow down and use their second monitors to play the 24/7 Burning Yule Log, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly sent out an internal memo this week telling staff that the company was in a “code red” effort and would need to focus all its energy on improving ChatGPT—even if it meant pausing other projects. The memo landed as rivals like Google Gemini increasingly put pressure on ChatGPT to stay atop the chatbot market. Altman’s directive and subsequent social media posts from other OpenAI execs say that staff have been asked to prioritize expanding the audience for the tool, which currently boasts 800 million weekly users, as well as making it feel more personal and intuitive: • Altman said that other projects like shopping, AI agents, and its personal assistant Pulse would take a backseat for the time being. • OpenAI will also start hosting a special daily call for employees working on ChatGPT. No way they’re getting away with keeping their cameras off. OpenAI is losing ground. — The latest release of Google’s Gemini chatbot lapped OpenAI’s ChatGPT in a number of industry benchmark tests, and users are taking notice: • Google said its Gemini app has jumped from 450 million monthly users in July to 650 million in October, thanks largely to the first release of AI image generator Nano Banana in August. • Anthropic is also gaining traction, jumping from under 1,000 enterprise customers two years ago to 300,000+ in September. The upstart recently acquired AI developer Bun to beef up its coding automation tool. Big picture: — While Gemini has the added bonus of existing in one of the most lucrative online ecosystems, OpenAI is burning through investment dollars.

Who qualifies? — About 25 million American children age 10 and under, born before this year, who live in areas where the median income is $150,000 or less. Eligible kids will automatically receive $250 in the Trump accounts their parents set up, the Dells said. This supplements the government’s plan to drop $1,000 into each Trump account opened for American babies born this year through 2028. Dell Technologies will also match that $1,000 for new children of its employees. What’s a Trump account? — An investment account that will be available in July 2026 to grow a child’s nest egg with taxes deferred until withdrawal. Once recipients turn 18, they can spend the money on education, homebuying, or startup costs, or roll it over into an IRA. President Trump previously credited Dell with bringing him the idea. Zoom out: — Though some tax experts aren’t sure Trump accounts are better than existing investment options, seed money is sure to sweeten the deal.

19adec288fc5ba43_2,Will a SCOTUS decision turn off your internet?,"The Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday in a billion-dollar internet piracy case that could decide if internet service providers (ISPs) are liable for the digital theft perpetrated by their customers who simply refuse to pay for that new Sabrina Carpenter track. Sony and a group of other music labels claim that Cox Communications should be held responsible for its customers repeatedly violating copyright laws. Cox, which provides internet service to 6 million homes and businesses, says if it’s found culpable, it could lead to all ISPs cutting off internet access for millions of Americans. How we got here: — In 2019, a court ruled against Cox and awarded Sony $1 billion in damages for the 10,017 songs at issue. An appeals court threw out the monetary award and ordered a new trial based on reduced violations. Cox turned to SCOTUS, arguing against the initial ruling that it had participated in “willful contributory infringement,” and saying a new trial could result in an even bigger penalty. The arguments • The music labels assert that Cox was sent numerous notices of IP addresses violating copyright and refused to act. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, aka DMCA (shout-out to Napster), made it illegal to download and distribute copyrighted music online—but an email from a Cox manager in charge of overseeing the application of the law reads, “F the dmca!!!” • Cox argued that courts have previously said that, for contributory infringement, companies must be aware of the infractions and further the illegalities, which Cox says it never did. Per Reuters, the justices seemed skeptical of that argument. Big Tech’s big interest: — Google and X are backing Cox, with X stating that if creators can sue AI platforms when people use their technology for violating copyright laws, the company would “have no choice but to constrain their actions” to avoid potential liability. Don’t worry, — SCOTUS isn’t expected to rule until the summer, so there’s still plenty of time to add malware illegal music to your laptop. —DL",2025-12-02 10:52:46

19adec288fc5ba43_6,Airbus is now the one with plane problems,"It’s not Boeing this time. Airbus said yesterday that it will inspect hundreds of its A320 planes after discovering some of them might have a faulty fuselage panel due to a “supplier-quality issue.” The reputation-dinting revelation, first reported by Reuters, came after the European planemaking giant recalled 6,000 A320-family aircraft over the weekend due to a separate software glitch. The issues sent the Boeing rival’s stock nosediving as much as 10% yesterday. Sun-snarled software The computer issue impacting the A320’s control system is believed to be caused by geomagnetic storms spurred by intensified solar flares. The glitch is suspected to have caused a Cancun, Mexico–Newark, NJ flight to abruptly lose altitude in October, leading to the hospitalization of several passengers. With A320s recently surpassing Boeing’s 737s as the world’s bestselling planes, the weekend recall was felt in airports worldwide: • It affected over 500 planes stateside at a number of US airlines, including American and Delta, and JetBlue canceled 70 flights on Sunday. But they largely avoided major disruptions during the Thanksgiving travel rush. • Dozens of flights were cancelled across New Zealand, Japan, and Germany, while Colombia’s Avianca closed ticket sales through December 8. Bottom line: — Airbus said yesterday that most of the planes impacted by the software hiccup had been modified as necessary and that the hardware hitch had been “identified and contained.” Of the more than 600 aircraft that could have the panel issue, most have not yet been delivered, and only 168 are currently in service. —SK",2025-12-02 10:52:46

In a decision that referenced deepfakes and social unrest, Oxford University Press named “rage bait” as the most culturally significant expression of 2025. The phrase’s usage tripled in the last 12 months, according to Oxford. “Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we’ve seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions,” the president of Oxford Languages said in a statement. You’ve probably been rage baited: — The term applies to online content that’s designed to frustrate viewers in order to drive views, comments, and other engagement. It can take the form of staged public arguments, cooking “hacks” that ask you to boil pasta in the dishwasher, or POV videos of posters asking strangers irritating questions (which often blur the line between rage bait and rudeness). For brands… — the rage bait era may provide leeway for marketing campaigns that many find offensive. Though it wasn’t intended as rage bait, American Eagle’s heavily criticized Sydney Sweeney campaign was a massive success, the company’s CMO told Marketing Brew.

19adec288fc5ba43_8,Prime number: Should phones be PG-13?,"Anyone who’s had to tear themselves away from watching just one more cute puppy video at 3am probably has an inkling that having a smartphone might be hazardous to your health. And a new study published in the journal Pediatrics could provide some fodder for parents trying to impress that on their tweens: • The study, based on data from 10,588 children, found that getting a smartphone before turning 13 was associated with worse health outcomes. • Compared to kids without phones, those who got their first one by age 12 had a 31% higher risk of depression, 40% higher risk of obesity, and 62% higher risk of not getting enough sleep. That’s not great news, since the median age for kids in the US to get a cellphone is 11. And there’s only so much parents can do: The study found that the younger kids were when they got a phone, the greater the risks—but even among children who hadn’t gotten a phone before age 12, when they finally got their own device, they had worse sleep a year later than those who still hadn’t gotten one, the study found. —AR",2025-12-02 10:52:46

19ad979dfb46cf6f_2,Where should we draw the poverty line?,"Officially, the Department of Health and Human Services declares the US poverty line as $32,150 for a family of four. But Simplify Asset Management Chief Strategist and Portfolio Manager Michael Green went viral last week for saying the line should really be $140,000 . Whose line is it anyway? — We got the poverty line as a metric in 1965, after then-President Lyndon Johnson launched the “War on Poverty.” The measurement took the cost of feeding a household in a year, multiplied that by three, and compared it to annual income. But Green says that doesn’t reflect modern life, — since food is cheaper now, but essential costs like healthcare and shelter have increased dramatically. When you adjust for those realities, Green said: • The poverty line is not $32,150, as the government currently measures it. • It should actually be at least $136,500, and anything short of that would limit a household’s participation in the economy. Line of fire The rebuttals have been rolling in. Green’s essay got a lot of positive feedback, like from entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, who called it a “ must-read for every person in business or finance.” But experts weren’t completely sold on Green’s methodology, even if they agreed with his larger point about the metric being antiquated. Some critics couldn’t get past Green’s arithmetic. Economist Noah Smith wrote for the Noahpinion blog that Green’s new red line is “ very silly ” because most Americans aren’t actually living impoverished lifestyles. Big picture: — Officially, about 10% of Americans live below the poverty line, but a recent Harris Poll survey found that one-third of six-figure earners feel financially stretched. The median household income for US families with at least two children was $109,300 last year.— BC",2025-12-01 10:24:10

It’s the biggest online shopping day of the year, and the results will offer a window into the state of the US consumer. Additional data will come in the form of earnings reports this week. American Eagle delivers results on Tuesday, followed by Dollar Tree, Five Below, and Macy’s on Wednesday. Then, Kroger, Ulta, and Dollar General report earnings on Thursday, and Victoria’s Secret reports on Friday. Preliminary consumer sentiment data will also be released by the University of Michigan on Friday. Luigi Mangione is back in court: — Starting today, a New York judge will hear arguments about whether certain evidence can be used in the state case against Mangione, who is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December. Defense attorneys are trying to block the prosecution from entering a notebook found in Mangione’s backpack into evidence. Prosecutors have said his writings help establish a possible motive. The defense is also trying to block prosecutors from using Mangione’s statements to police, arguing he wasn’t properly read his rights. Mangione has pleaded not guilty in the New York case. He also faces federal charges and charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested. Big week for football in America: — The draw for the upcoming World Cup—hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico—will take place on Friday. Then, the match times and venues will be announced on Saturday. Elsewhere in the soccer world, Lionel Messi’s never-ending quest to add to his trophy case continues in South Florida on Saturday, when Messi’s Inter Miami hosts Vancouver in the MLS Cup final. The other kind of football (the one with the pigskin) is also heating up this weekend, with some of the nation’s top college teams hoping they can make it out of their conference championships with their playoff hopes still alive.

19ad979dfb46cf6f_8,Prime number: 0 hurricanes made landfall in the US,"The 2025 North Atlantic hurricane season is officially over, and for the first time since 2015, not a single one made landfall in the US. There was still plenty of activity, however: • The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-average season of activity for 2025. The agency said that the season fell within the ranges it predicted for “named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes.” • Between June 1 and November 30, the Atlantic basin produced 13 named storms and five hurricanes. • Three of the hurricanes reached Category 5 status, a tie for the second-most on record. While the US got off scot-free on the hurricanes-making-landfall front this year, other nations were nowhere near as lucky. Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 and brought significant devastation at the end of October before moving on and hitting Cuba as a major hurricane. Melissa ranks in the top three strongest hurricanes ever to make landfall in the Atlantic basin, according to The Weather Channel.— HVL",2025-12-01 10:24:10

19acf2c3be7e3fce_1,Big Ski dominates the slopes,"A snowboarder gliding down a perfectly powdered Colorado slope and a skier skidding on an ice sheet in Vermont could be paying the same company for the tush-freezing lift up the mountain. The ski industry has been consolidating for decades due to the rising cost of running the slopes. Almost 3 in 5 North American ski resorts closed between the 1960s and 2022, while many of those that remained were gobbled up by private equity-backed companies—with Colorado-based skiing behemoths Vail Resorts and Alterra Mountain Co. leading the pack: • 37% of the US’ 375 public ski areas are run by slope conglomerates, according to an analysis by ski industry writer Stuart Winchester. • Alterra and Vail operate 14% of public US ski areas with a lift, stretching from the Rockies to the Appalachians—and their ownership of large ski resorts puts them in control of half the country’s lift capacity . Pass hegemony The two juggernauts have upended snowy peak economics by selling seasonal passes that give skiers unlimited access to dozens of resorts at a fixed price. The advent of Vail’s Epic Pass in 2008 and the launch of Alterra’s rival Ikon Pass in 2018 allowed the companies to enjoy predictable revenue in an industry constrained by capricious weather patterns. In December 2023, Vail’s then-CEO said ski passes accounted for ~73% of the company’s overall lift-ticket revenue. There’s a catch: — While offering a relatively good deal to those willing to make skiing their entire personality commit to hitting the slopes all winter, Vail and Alterra jacked up the price of one-day lift tickets to incentivize seasonal pass signups. This season, weekend daily lift access at Vail’s top resorts costs an average $261, according to Bloomberg, while a seasonal pass that gives skiers unlimited access to 42 locations was $982. But some skiers are passing on the passes, complaining that the unlimited-access system has, in some cases, led to crowded slopes and lift lines stretching all the way to the lodges. Indie resorts are also getting a lift… — from overall growth in snow sports and an influx of disgruntled skiers eager for cheaper daily passes and a more rustic experience. They even banded together in 2019 to launch the Indy Pass, an alternative to Ikon and Epic for mom-and-pop resorts. The company distributes 85% of the pass proceeds among the resorts, which they use to fund upgrades to lift and snowmaking equipment. —SK",2025-11-29 10:24:26
19acf2c3be7e3fce_2,Shred the gnar at the Netflix founder’s private resort,"Netflix won the streaming wars by being the first to deliver entertainment to the masses, its vast library offering something for everyone as it scaled toward global domination. That’s made co-founder Reed Hastings a billionaire, but the philosophy behind his latest venture—a private, high-end ski community in the Utah wilderness—is less Netflix and more HBO. New kind of mile-high club Months after retiring as Netflix’s CEO in 2023, Hastings bought Powder Mountain for an undisclosed sum and has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars to turn it into the world’s most bespoke ski destination. The hope is that it can serve as a quieter alternative to the overcrowded mass-market slopes you see all over Instagram each winter. “This isn’t about exclusivity for its own sake,” Hastings told The Hollywood Reporter last year. “It’s about creating a sanctuary for people who love this mountain as much as we do.” Here’s how the unusual public-private resort works: • Memberships, which cost $25,000 annually (plus an initiation fee), give skiers exclusive access to 2,700 acres of pristine powder. The remaining 5,300 acres are open to the public. • To become a member, you must purchase real estate in the resort’s residential community, Powder Haven. Lots start at $2 million, and membership is capped at 650 families. • Real estate sales will help pay for improvements to the public side, including new chairlifts, to make sure it doesn’t get too crowded, either. Demand is high. — The first phase of development (39 lots) sold out in a few months, based solely on renderings and before roads were even paved , according to Robb Report. A 73,000-square-foot lodge with restaurants, pickleball courts, a gym, a pool, and a spa is under construction , per SFGate. But not everyone’s thrilled. — Some are worried that Hastings’s elite winter wonderland will price locals out (public pass prices have already increased). Others say that the changes threaten Powder’s mom-and-pop feel, which had set it apart from most mountains in the area. The Financial Times suggested the Netflix billionaire is “walking a gentrification tightrope.” —AE",2025-11-29 10:24:26
19acf2c3be7e3fce_3,The cannons keeping ski towns afloat,"When you tell your grandkids that you used to go bombing through dumps, the most unbelievable part of the story might be that there was ever so much fresh snowfall. Shorter, warmer winters are becoming more common, and most ski towns increasingly count on an imperfect fix—snow machines—to fill a growing void of white. Cold time is money: — To cushion lighter snowfall at the beginning and end of winter, the Aspen Snowmass resort upgraded its snowmakers this summer as part of a broader $80 million development project, for example. Without the tech, subpar skiing conditions can threaten not just resorts but also surrounding restaurants, hotels, and rental services. But… — the pressurized cannons dotting ski trails typically work in tandem with local weather, so there’s usually only so much that they can do: • Basic snowmakers shoot out high-pressure water and condensed air, meaning they’re useless if it’s not cold enough outside. Some Colorado ski resorts had to switch off their snowguns at the beginning of November, when temperatures got into the 60s. • A resort’s snow machines can take days to weeks to cover the slopes, depending on how much natural powder there is already. At the extreme end, it required nearly two months, almost 400 snowguns, and an estimated $60 million to completely blanket barren mountain venues for the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Conundrum: — Newer snow machines can work in up to 80-degree weather, but they cost as much as $500,000, compared to $15,000 to $30,000 for traditional models, according to the Washington Post. They’re also energy-intensive, which exacerbates the core issue facing ski towns: snowmakers are “pretty much using the cause [of climate change] to find a solution,” a spokesperson for TechnoAlpin, a leading snowmaking company, told the outlet. Looking ahead… — based on current greenhouse gas predictions, lower-altitude ski towns could see 80% less snowfall by 2100. —ML",2025-11-29 10:24:26
19acf2c3be7e3fce_4,Skiing can be dirt cheap—or a wallet wipeout,"The cheapest way to get a thrill out of a snowy slope is by sledding down your local hill on a piece of cardboard. But if your heart yearns for the skis or snowboard, the price tag of the experience varies as much as the hot cocoa quality across the lodges. Some of the world’s most upscale ski resorts catering to the jet set are clustered in the Rockies and the Alps: • A one-day ski pass at the Aspen resort in Colorado goes for as much as $279 during peak season, granting access to high-altitude skiing on four mountains—the tallest of which stands at 11,212 feet. The surrounding area is dotted with luxury shopping options and hotels averaging $960 a night during peak season, according to budgetmytrip.com. • On the flip side, at Courchevel 1850 in France, which is considered the ritziest Alpine ski resort, daily lift tickets are a more affordable $86 during high season—even with its Gucci-branded gondolas and proximity to several Michelin star restaurants. But for those of us unaccustomed to traveling by helicopter, the best bet is an independent ski resort, like the Turner Mountain in Montana, where a daily pass is just $45. Here’s a list of other budget destinations in the US. There’s options to ski for the price of a sandwich… — if you’re willing to travel to super bargains like the 4,757-footer at Kolašin 1450 in Montenegro ($29 per day) or Denizli ski resort in Turkey, which charges $7. —SK",2025-11-29 10:24:26

19ac9cf8d2091511_2,You’re probably not saving 60%,"Camping out for a heavily discounted flat-screen TV on Black Friday feels like the stuff of ancient legend these days. Most shopping is now done online, and deals that used to be reserved for one day have been stretched to cover the weeks before Thanksgiving—if not most of November. Plus, some “discounts” aren’t what they appear to be. Signs can be misleading Most items marked as “on sale” include an original or list price to show you just how much you’re saving—but retailers can artificially inflate these “original” prices or mark down goods for months to give the illusion of a sale. Buyer beware: — The Washington Post’s Geoffrey A. Fowler compared the prices of 50 items he previously purchased on Amazon (like toys, printer toner, clothes, etc.) in the six months leading up to Prime Big Deal Days in October with their prices during the sale on Oct. 8. He found that if he had waited to buy those items during Prime Big Deal Days, he would have saved just 0.6%. Some items were even more expensive during the sale. Similarly, Consumers’ Checkbook tracked popular sale items from 25 major retailers, and 12 of those retailers (including Bass Pro Shops, Gap, Michaels, and Wayfair) listed half of their items on sale for nearly 25 weeks straight.

19ac9cf8d2091511_3,The coupon’s not dead yet,"An American-born shopping strategy may be in the midst of a mini comeback. The days of couponing so hard that you get on a TLC show are over, but post-pandemic grocery inflation has ushered in a new wave of deal fiends. Although coupon use plummeted to an all-time low in 2022: • Redemptions ticked up in 2023 and 2024, mostly driven by digital offers rather than traditional newspaper inserts, according to Inmar Intelligence. • More than 25% of US adults are using more coupons because of the state of the economy, up from 18% in mid-2021, according to a 2024 survey by the National Retail Federation. Rebound: — In September, Kroger reported a “lift” in the number of products sold after the grocery chain reintroduced paper coupons. Bargain shoppers also logged a win in August, when Bed Bath & Beyond Home opened its first store under its new banner and brought back its legendary 20% coupon. This time around, though, it can’t be used with other offers. The deals aren’t what they used to be Gone is the era of combining enough coupons to save 75% at checkout (or even be owed money by the store): • Walmart, ShopRite, and Target don’t let shoppers use more than four of the same paper coupon in one day anymore. • Many retailers have also stopped giving cash back on coupons of a higher value than the purchase price. • To limit fraud risks , some stores don’t allow printouts from Coupons.com—or any coupons that aren’t on their master list, even if they’re legitimate. Where the Extreme Coupon ers are now: — Many stars of the 2011–2012 TLC show moved on from coupon-clipping to maxing out their 401(k) and IRA contributions and racking up hotel loyalty points for cheaper travel. They told the Wall Street Journal that this offers higher returns for a drastically lower time commitment. Probably fewer paper cuts, too. —ML",2025-11-28 09:24:20
19ac9cf8d2091511_4,Are all of these loyaltyschemesprograms worth it?,"You’re just six more purchases from a free coffee. You’re four more hole punches from a free sandwich. If you amass 500 more points, that airline will let you fly the plane. Maybe that last one isn’t real (yet), but loyalty programs have become ubiquitous. As of 2016, long before the current loyalty gold rush, Accenture reported that 90% of companies already had programs that gave you “free” stuff for making purchases. But these plans can come at a cost. Loyalty being punished? If you’ve noticed the perks aren’t as perky as they were when you first joined a given club, you might not be imagining things. The Washington Post looked into potential loyalty paranoia and instead found that Starbucks and other companies might use your info to cut back on your deals through surveillance pricing: • Former FTC officials Samuel Levine and Stephanie Nguyen told the outlet that some companies will use AI and your personal data to charge higher prices to specific patrons. • A study from the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator and the University of California at Berkeley’s Center for Consumer Law & Economic Justice also found that these programs can invert the idea of loyalty, benefiting companies more than customers. Data concerns: — Ask that app not to track all you want, but some are still able to gather enough data in other ways to determine things like your income and how much money you’re willing to fork over. The author of the WaPo story requested and received his data report from Starbucks, which showed every drink and snack he had bought, every offer he had received, and every tap he made in the app. That kind of data could be shared with dozens of tech firms that specialize in tailoring prices. Open investigation: — The FTC began investigating surveillance pricing in July 2024, but when the Trump administration took office, it halted the probe. Levine and Nguyen said they’d like to see it resume. Noting that in some cases loyalty programs may be the only path to a discount, Levine told WaPo, “We shouldn’t be put in a position where we have to decide between affording our groceries and protecting our privacy.” —DL",2025-11-28 09:24:20
19ac9cf8d2091511_5,Is today a holiday?,"You might wait to buy a new mattress on Presidents Day or Memorial Day, but if you want to camp out outside a big-box store and possibly get in a fist fight on your way through the door, there’s only one Black Friday. And unlike those other two, the “holiday” is all about shopping—and it’s not the only one, as made-up discount celebrations proliferate. Where does Black Friday come from? • The term originated in a very different corner of capitalism, as it was the descriptor given to a September 1869 stock market crash brought on by a panic caused by gold speculators. • It reemerged in Philadelphia in the 1950s, and this time it was about the day after Thanksgiving—but not yet about getting cheap gifts at the start of the holiday season. The day fell between Turkey Day and the Army–Navy football game, bringing huge crowds to the city and straining its police force. • Clever retailers latched onto the name in the 1980s, creating the shopping ritual we now know. This time, “black” was used like accountants do, to reflect profitability, as opposed to being in the red. Black Friday has spawned imitators… — with Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday rounding out the shopping weekend. The National Retail Federation expects that a record 186.9 million people will shop during the five-day period following Thanksgiving this year. And some retailers have cooked up their own special shopping days, with Amazon’s Prime Day, born in July 2015, chief among them. The “day,” which now lasts several days twice a year, has copycats of its own, with competitors like Walmart and Target staging sales at similar times. But the biggest one has yet to feature on most US calendars: — There’s a shopping holiday in China known as Singles Day that recently generated ~$150 billion in sales—more than Black Friday and Prime Day combined. Falling on Nov. 11 (picked for all the ones in the date), it’s the main sales event for China’s answer to Amazon, Alibaba.

The reserve can no longer fully absorb a decline in its value. A drop in Bitcoin's value, combined with a decline in the value of other high-risk assets, could lead to USDT being undercollateralized. The token's other weaknesses include limited transparency on research management, a lack of asset segregation to protect against Tether's insolvency, and limitations on redeeming USDT with Tether directly.

19abfcea4648f503_2,Americans are still spending—but they want a deal,"The government’s retail data is finally trickling in after shutdown-related delays and the economic verdict is...meh. US retail sales (not adjusted for inflation) rose just 0.2% in September, compared to a 0.6% jump in August, according to the Commerce Department. Economists were hoping for growth of at least 0.3%. The lackluster numbers wrap up what was an otherwise solid Q3 for US retailers, with July posting 0.65% growth. The data suggests that shoppers are cooling on splurging on items like clothes and vehicles but are still spending on personal-care items and furniture. Americans also still seemed willing to go out to bars and restaurants. Bargain retailers benefit Companies that pride themselves on values and discounts are doing well: Walmart’s Q3 sales beat estimates , and the company raised its profit outlook for the second time this year. TJX Companies, which owns and chaotically organizes both TJ Maxx and Marshalls, also raised annual sales and profit estimates last week. Best Buy, meanwhile, reported a 2.7% increase in same-store sales, its biggest quarterly gain in four years, though CEO Corie Barry said that customers were being more “thoughtful” about big-ticket items. Not spending equally. — Some economists continue to point to the so-called K-shaped economy—or a growing divide between high-income spenders and everyone else. An analysis of Federal Reserve data showed that the top 10% income bracket made up almost half of total consumer spending in Q2. Looking ahead… — despite affordability fears, the holiday-shopping season could be a good one for retailers. Mastercard is expecting a 3.6% jump in seasonal spending this year—not necessarily driven by shoppers buying more, but rather them paying higher prices on pretty much everything. A recent survey by the Conference Board showed consumer confidence cratering.— MM",2025-11-26 10:38:19

Under the deal, Google would provide Meta with tensor processing units (TPUs), which can be customized for specific AI functions. That differs from Nvidia’s industry-standard GPUs, which were originally designed to render visual graphics. The reported deal comes at a good time for Google and a bad time for Nvidia: The search giant recently inked a multibillion-dollar chip agreement with Anthropic, while AI-bubble fears already dragged Nvidia’s stock down more than 10% from a late-October peak.

19abfcea4648f503_6,More homesellers are giving up amid a slow market,"People selling their homes are acting like a jaded single who keeps deleting Hinge. In September, homesellers delisted their properties at the highest rate in eight years, according to a Redfin study published yesterday. Delistings surged 28% in September from the year before—with 5.5% of listed homes having their for-sale yard signs yanked that month, the largest share since at least 2016. Because it’s a buyer’s market High mortgage rates and economic uncertainty have made the early 2020s housing frenzy feel as fleeting as the sourdough baking fad—with many homes now languishing on the market for months. For many sellers, offering a discount is the only way to woo buyers: • 57% of properties sold in the first ten months of 2025 got a price cut, compared to 47% between 2020 and 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors. • For people who bought their homes recently, that often entails selling at a loss. Of the properties delisted from Redfin in September, about 15% were at risk of selling below purchase price, a five-year high. That might explain why folks who purchased their homes in the past five years were behind a disproportionate number of delistings, per Redfin. But… — some sellers pull their home from Redfin and later relist it in order to make it appear as a fresh offering and hide a price cut. —SK",2025-11-26 10:38:19

If you were willing to wait nearly four years for the conclusion of your favorite show, you’re probably willing to endure Netflix’s plan for releasing the final episodes in installments. Four will come out tonight, three more will be released on Christmas, and the finale arrives on New Year’s Eve. It’s hard to argue with the strategy: • Netflix’s subscriber count has jumped from about 94 million in 2016 to more than 700 million today. • The show’s first four seasons all landed in Netflix’s most recent weekly top 10, a first for the platform and a sign of the buzz that Netflix wants to draw out over the course of several weeks. Warming to theaters: — Earlier this year, CEO Ted Sarandos called the idea of releasing movies in theaters “outmoded,” but the Stranger Things series finale will spend two days in 350 cinemas. The release comes as Netflix is reportedly willing to keep Warner Bros. Discovery movies in theaters, if it wins its bid to buy the company. What’s next? — There’s still more Hawkins content coming: A play, an animated show, and a live-action spinoff are in the offing. Hopefully, no one in those casts will be nearing a mid-life crisis when the runs are over. —DL",2025-11-26 10:38:19

19abaaea8f625912_2,Novo Nordisk found something Ozempic can’t do,"The idea that semaglutide could help treat diabetes, obesity, potentially addiction, and the most common cause of dementia appears too good to be true: An Ozempic-like drug failed in a highly anticipated Alzheimer’s trial, Novo Nordisk announced yesterday. • Trial participants who took a pill version of the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy showed some improvement in Alzheimer’s biomarkers, but it did nothing to delay the disease’s progression, according to Novo Nordisk. • The trial was inspired by earlier research suggesting that people with Type 2 diabetes who took semaglutide had lower rates of dementia than groups who took other diabetes drugs or placebos. Rare L: — Novo Nordisk previously referred to this trial as a long-shot “lottery ticket,” so investors weren’t counting on positive results. Still, it’s jarring for pharma bulls to see “semaglutide” and “fails” in the same sentence. Shares of the Danish drugmaker hit a four-year low yesterday, but regained some ground once the disappointment settled. Hail Mary incomplete This was one of Novo Nordisk’s last chances of 2025 to reinvigorate its stock, which has nearly halved this year, despite semaglutide’s popularity. The company ousted its eight-year CEO and installed a new one in August to turn its fortune around and claw back some of the market share it lost to Eli Lilly in recent years. Like Skype vs. Zoom: — Though Ozempic had a four-year head start over Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound, Eli Lilly recently overtook Novo Nordisk as the US leader in weight-loss medication. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk lowered its profit guidance several times this year, saying copycat semaglutide was partially to blame. A hole probably appeared in the drywall of Novo’s headquarters when Eli Lilly became the first pharmaceutical company to hit a $1 trillion market cap last week. Another challenger emerges: — Pfizer is also jockeying for space in weight-loss and outbid Novo Nordisk earlier this month for an obesity-drug startup called Metsera. —ML",2025-11-25 10:52:38

19abaaea8f625912_6,The bond market is overrun by AI,"Tech giants are issuing IOUs as frantically as that classmate who was always asking everyone to spot him a dollar for vending machine snacks—and it’s dampening the prices of their bonds. The bond market is currently dominated by companies raising cash for data centers and shiny new AI models. That deluge of AI debt has caused Big Tech’s bonds to trade at the highest yields compared to safer bonds since President Trump introduced sweeping tariffs in April. Buy bonds, AI bonds Bonds are becoming a larger part of AI borrowing and vice versa: • AI companies surpassed banks as the largest high-grade bond issuers in the US, accounting for 14% of bond debt this year, according to JPMorgan. • So-called AI hyperscalers like Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Oracle issued $90 billion in investment-grade bonds since the start of September, more than in the preceding 40 months, Dealogic data cited by the Wall Street Journal shows. Investors in some cases seem anxious about the debt’s safety. The price of default insurance for Oracle’s bonds, for instance, tripled in the past month. But many of the AI-financing bonds are being sold by cash-flush tech behemoths with stronger credit ratings than Oracle. Looking ahead: — Morgan Stanley analysts recently said that if the AI borrowing fest continues past 2025, it could affect the bond market as a whole. —SK",2025-11-25 10:52:38

The FAA is bracing for its busiest Thanksgiving week in 15 years, with more than 360,000 flights scheduled between yesterday and next Tuesday. The TSA anticipates screening 17.8 million people, many of whom will be dressed comfortably, despite Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s attempt at pajama-shaming flyers last week. Other options may be equally hectic, per AAA: • About 73.2 million people will be behind the wheel, a 1.8% increase over last year. According to the transportation analytics firm Inrix, the worst times to hit the road in major metro areas are in the afternoon today and tomorrow. • The number of bus, train, and cruise-goers is predicted to climb 8.5% compared to last year.

19abaaea8f625912_8,Prime number: Cigarettes are starring in more films,"It seems pop culture can’t quit smoking. Despite years of taboo, cigarettes are being embraced by celebrities and pop singers, and have recently shown up more in movies, the Wall Street Journal reports : • Around half of the films released last year featured cigarettes or other tobacco products, up from just 10% the year before, according to public health nonprofit Truth Initiative and the University of Chicago’s NORC research organization. • That’s in spite of major tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds saying they actively send cease-and-desist letters to keep their products off screens. Although smoking rates in the US are currently at their lowest in ~80 years, public health advocates—many of whom have worked tirelessly for decades to make smoking less cool—find the trend alarming. They’ve got reason to: The CDC found in 2019 that young people “heavily exposed to onscreen smoking imagery” are more likely to start smoking than those with minimal exposure. Federal officials have linked smoking to one in three cancer deaths in the US and 30+ other health concerns. —AR",2025-11-25 10:52:38

And, on Friday, Alphabet passed Microsoft to become the third-most valuable US company by market cap (take that, Mico), days after launching its newest AI model, Gemini 3, last Tuesday. Beyond doodling Gemini 3 vaulted over its competitors in the AI chatbot race, surpassing ChatGPT and other models in industry benchmark tests. Then, on Thursday, Google launched an updated version of its image-generation tool, Nano Banana Pro, which VP of Google Labs and Gemini Josh Woodward told CNBC is “incredible at infographics” (it also makes slide decks). It’s a long way from 2022, when investors were concerned that Google was falling behind in the AI race. This Alphabet is bigger than A and I Last quarter, Alphabet’s cloud revenue jumped 32%, and its search revenue grew 15% year over year. As if that weren’t enough, its video-sharing platform, YouTube, has cemented itself as part of the bedrock of the internet. According to a new report from the Pew Research Center on Americans’ social media usage this year: • YouTube is the most widely used online platform among both US adults and teens. • 84% of US adults say they’ve used YouTube. Facebook came in second at 71%. • Nearly half of adults get on YouTube daily. Google drive: — Google subsidiary Waymo has also been firing on all cylinders...figuratively (they’re electric). Waymo is up and running in five cities around the country, with plans to expand into 12 more.

Screenshots proliferated across the platform, with users alleging they had uncovered the origins of several prominent MAGA accounts, which had claimed to be based in the United States, as being based out of Africa, Macedonia, and South Asia. On Friday morning, posts claiming to show that the US Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS) account was based in Tel Aviv, Israel, went viral, before the feature disappeared from X temporarily. A global rollout officially took place on Saturday. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, responded to some of the outraged tweets, saying that the rumor of the DHS account’s origins showing up as Israel was “fake news.” On Sunday, DHS released an official denial of its account having been operated in Israel.— HVL",2025-11-24 10:24:22

That’s a new record for a Broadway adaptation after breaking the $112.5 million benchmark set by last year’s hit… Wicked . It’s the second-biggest US opening this year, behind A Minecraft Movie ’s $162 million opening weekend, but ahead of the Lilo & Stitch remake ($146 million). Are you sensing a theme here? There’s a reason it’s pronounced Wic- kid . — The movie is rated PG, which remains the most lucrative rating for films these days, and the children want to go see it. Last year, PG movies accounted for 36.3% of box-office receipts, according to Comscore, an amount expected to be matched or exceeded this year.

Once they get to their destinations, they’ll have plenty to watch, between the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the National Dog Show, and three NFL games: Detroit vs. Green Bay, Dallas vs. Kansas City, and Baltimore vs. Cincinnati. The Lions and Cowboys are both playing on Thanksgiving Day for the 48th year in a row. Holiday shopping season officially arrives: — Retailers are in store for a record number of shoppers this holiday weekend, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF). Nearly 187 million consumers are expected to shop this year from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, formally kicking off what’s projected to be a gargantuan retail sales season. The NRF expects holiday sales to top $1 trillion for the first time this year, even as consumers have an increasingly gloomy opinion of the overall economy. Turn things up to Eleven: — Wave goodbye to the end of beginning. The final season of Stranger Things premieres on Netflix this Wednesday. The season will be spread out over three release dates. The first four episodes will be out on Wednesday, three more will be released on Christmas Day, and the series finale will drop on New Year’s Eve, wrapping up the sci-fi show’s nine-and-a-half-year run.

Backstory: — The watch belonged to Isidor Straus, 67, a co-founder of the Macy’s department store chain who was traveling first class on the doomed ship with his wife, Ida, 63. • According to contemporary witnesses, Isidor refused to board a lifeboat because there was not enough space for all passengers, and Ida remained at his side. • They held each other on the ship’s deck until they perished. • Isidor’s body, along with the watch, was recovered, while Ida was never found. Another twist: — Wendy Rush, the great-great-granddaughter of Isidor and Ida Straus, was married to Stockton Rush, the co-founder and CEO of OceanGate. Stockton died in 2023, when his experimental research vehicle the OceanGate Titan imploded during an attempt to visit the Titanic wreckage site.

19aab3b09a7c7495_2,Eli Lilly is worth a trillion whole dollars,"Roll out the oversized sheet cake and throw on some Pitbull, because Eli Lilly hit a $1 trillion market cap yesterday. The drugmaker’s shares surged over 1.6% Friday, pushing it to become the first healthcare company and second non-tech company to hit the milestone. It’s all thanks to the GLP-1s. — Obesity and diabetes drugs, including blockbusters Zepbound and Mounjaro, now account for over half of Eli Lilly’s total revenue, bringing in $10.09 billion of its total $17.6 billion last quarter. The company’s stock has rocketed up more than 75% since it introduced its obesity drug Zepbound in 2023, according to Reuters. The stock has jumped up 36% this year alone. And the company is well positioned to take on its rivals, including Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, which sells the GLP-1s Wegovy and Ozempic. • When Novo Nordisk first gained approval to sell Ozempic for weight loss, the drugmaker struggled with supply shortages, allowing Eli Lilly to swoop in and establish its stronghold on the $72 billion weight loss drug market. Other pharma companies are playing catch-up and desperately trying to acquire smaller drugmakers to get a leg up in the market. • Eli Lilly was set up to take the top spot after a massive overhaul of its research and development process in the last decade, following a number of expensive rollouts that flopped. • The company’s market value is more than twice that of its closest US competitor, Johnson & Johnson, which currently has a ~$490 billion market cap. Returns you can’t even comprehend The pharmaceutical industry’s white whale right now is a GLP-1 in pill form. Analysts think Eli Lilly has a better version in the works. It’s called orforglipron, and it doesn’t require patients to fast when taking it, like Novo’s oral GLP-1 does. Looking ahead… — Eli Lilly plans to file for FDA approval of its pill by the end of the year and put it on the market by mid-2026. Wall Street expects it could bring in $40 billion a year at its peak. —MM",2025-11-22 10:52:26

President Zelensky said the choice of whether to accept the plan means Ukraine would face “losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner.” Still, he vowed to work with the US, and said he’d spoken to Vice President JD Vance about the proposal. —SK",2025-11-22 10:52:26

19aab3b09a7c7495_6,Pre-Thanksgiving strolls are firing up weed sales,"The tradition of sneaking off to blaze up with cousins before Thanksgiving dinner is losing its stigma and translating into big money for the marijuana industry. With recreational weed now legal in 24 states and medical use allowed in 40, there’s less reason to hide that edible before the turkey comes out of the oven. And many appear to be partaking: • The day before you sit down with family and have uncomfortable conversations about politics and relationships has been dubbed Green Wednesday. • It’s the second-biggest day for legal weed sales behind April 20, aka 420 (not a cop), per cannabis-market tracker BDSA. The firm says that overall, the cannabis industry was worth more than $30 billion in the US last year. More weed, less booze: — Per Bloomberg, the total value of the world’s leading beer, wine, and spirits makers has dropped $830 million over the past four-plus years as attitudes change around weed and the adverse health effects of alcohol. Walking the walk: — Snack companies are also becoming more comfortable marketing to stoners. Last year, Jif posted an ad to Instagram invoking the cousin walk, while a Taco Bell/Hidden Valley collab also referenced a similar stroll before Christmas dinner. Meanwhile, a New York dispensary has an ad out now for pre-rolled joints for “a secret society that meets once a year.” —DL",2025-11-22 10:52:26

19aa5f7a98885615_2,Delayed jobs report is here. We hope you like riddles,"Nobody’s quite sure what the Federal Reserve’s next move for interest rates will be after the latest economic temperature check. The September jobs report came out yesterday—nearly two months late due to the government shutdown—and it painted a cryptic picture of surprising job growth alongside rising unemployment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, here’s the good: • The US added 119,000 nonfarm positions in September, beating economists’ expectations of 50,000, per Wall Street Journal polling. • That’s the strongest gain in five months (and it contradicts an earlier report of September job losses from the payroll-processing giant ADP). And the bad: • Unemployment rose to a four-year high of 4.4%, which reflects “both the positive dynamic of more Americans participating in the workforce and the gloomier reality of more people losing their jobs,” Bloomberg reported . • Average hourly wages, which tend to indicate the direction of consumer spending, notched their smallest increase since June. What this means for interest rates Stronger-than-expected job gains present an argument for the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting, but on the other hand, rising unemployment is potentially a reason to slash. Fed officials were already in disagreement at their last meeting, and yesterday’s numbers will likely deepen their discord. That’s all, folks. — Partial October job numbers won’t come out until after the Fed meets in December, and inflation stats for the month might never be released. That means the belated September report is one of the biggest bits of official data that’ll inform the next interest rate decision. But it’s also old news: — The Fed may consider more recent, less rosy dispatches from the private sector that indicate declines in both consumer sentiment and small-business optimism. Also, UPS and Amazon are among several companies to recently announce thousands of layoffs, while Home Depot and Target lowered their full-year expectations, citing a pullback among shoppers. —ML",2025-11-21 10:23:03

The aircraft, which was fully loaded with fuel for a flight to Hawaii, crashed seconds after takeoff, according to video footage. Its engine was on fire and detached before the plane hit the ground. Per the Wall Street Journal, investigators stopped short of blaming the crash on the fatigue cracks and aren’t expected to release a conclusion until a year after the incident.

Netflix has long resisted putting its films in theaters, preferring to release them directly on its streaming service (though it has made exceptions for certain movies to qualify for awards consideration). The move would make Netflix’s bid to purchase WBD “more palatable,” per Bloomberg. WBD put itself up for sale last month, drawing interest from Paramount Skydance and Comcast, in addition to Netflix.

The retail giant said yesterday that it’s ditching the New York Stock Exchange favored by legacy industry to start hawking its shares on the tech-focused Nasdaq on Dec. 9. Walmart, which has been listed on the NYSE since 1972, announced its plan to move—amounting to the biggest poach in Nasdaq’s history—during its Q3 earnings call. To explain, the company emphasized its e-commerce push and its embrace of AI and warehouse automation for cheaper and faster delivery. The retailer said its Q3 online sales grew 27% globally from the same period last year. Value emporium Less surprising in its earnings report was Walmart saying its bread and butter of offering bargains is a boon amid economic choppiness. Stores that have been open at least a year grew their sales 4.5% in Q3 compared to a year ago, as Walmart wooed shoppers trading down to its more affordable offerings. But… — Walmart noted that it is seeing restrained spending among low-income shoppers, as customers shift their dollars from discretionary items to necessities—potentially reflected in faster growth for sales of groceries and health items than other merchandise categories. —SK",2025-11-21 10:23:03

A recent report by the Public Interest Research Group found that some AI toys it tested were quick to discuss inappropriate topics with minors. OpenAI, whose GPT-4o chatbot model was used to power Singapore-based FoloToy, suspended its relationship with the company, after researchers were able to get the toymaker’s teddy bear to discuss sexual fetishes and give instructions about how to light a match and where to find knives in the home. Consumer advocacy group Fairplay issued its own warning yesterday, urging parents to avoid buying AI-enabled toys this holiday season. The group accuses the toys of preying on children’s trust, disrupting their relationships, and invading privacy: • A decade ago, Fairplay led the campaign against a wi-fi-connected talking Barbie doll, accusing it of recording children’s conversations. • Mattel announced a partnership with OpenAI in June, but hasn’t released specific plans for the tech.

Denmark’s GDP expanded by 2.3% in the third quarter, its biggest jump since 2021, thanks to Novo Nordisk and sales of its weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy: • Excluding pharmaceutical exports, Denmark’s GDP would have grown by only 0.7%. • Earlier this week, Novo lowered the prices of direct-to-consumer Ozempic and Wegovy from $499 per month to $349 per month. And yet, even as Novo props up Denmark’s economy, it’s dealing with some rotten news.

19aa0eda3e744c6a_2,Nvidia blows bubble fears and expectations away,"The world can stop worrying about an AI bubble, at least for now: AI chip-making linchpin Nvidia dropped a stellar earnings report yesterday that has at least temporarily eased concerns that the economy is on the verge of collapsing like a New York Mets team in September. • Revenue for Q3 reached $57.01 billion, above analyst estimates of $54.92 billion. • Data center sales totaled $51.2 billion, exceeding predictions of $49.09 billion and indicating that the appetite for AI is still growing. • CEO Jensen Huang said sales of the company’s next-generation Blackwell chips are “off the charts” and cloud GPUs are “sold out.” • The company is expecting $65 billion in revenue for the current quarter, also outpacing the $61.66 billion that analysts expect. The better-than-expected report sent Nvidia stock soaring 5% after hours. “The AI ecosystem is scaling fast—with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries,” Huang said. Much-needed good news: — This comes after weeks of AI stock selloffs, including Peter Thiel’s hedge fund unloading its entire stake in Nvidia, and Michael Burry, the 2008 housing market implosion soothsayer, revealing he bought put options on Nvidia, betting the stock price was going to drop, and warning of an AI bubble. Big Tech is in this together Since October 2022, the S&P 500 has been propped up by the Magnificent Seven stocks, which account for 75% of the gains that have pushed the index to record highs. Meanwhile, fellow members of that club—Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta—account for more than 40% of Nvidia’s sales. Then there are the circular investments involving OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, AMD, Microsoft, and Oracle that include billions in equity stakes between them. This has led to fears that if the tech giants and small circle of AI companies doing most of the spending pull back on their AI infrastructure buildouts, it will create a disastrous chain reaction for the economy.

Following three years of slowing action at auctions, Sotheby’s banged the gavel this week on a record-setting painting that signaled a possible reinvigoration in the collector world. After a 19-minute bidding war, Gustav Klimt’s 1914–1916 “Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer” sold for $236.4 million to an anonymous buyer, making it: • The most expensive work ever sold at Sotheby’s. • The most expensive 20th-century artwork ever auctioned, knocking Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe portrait to second place. • The second-most expensive art sold at any auction, with the top spot belonging to Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi,” which sold for $450 million at Christie’s in 2017. A piece of history: — The Lederers were one of the wealthiest dynasties in Vienna before Nazi Germany invaded Austria. The Nazis looted the Jewish family’s art, except for the family portraits. To avoid persecution, Elisabeth convinced the Nazis that she descended from Klimt, who was not Jewish. In today’s art market: — Sotheby’s and Christie’s each auctioned off more than $700 million worth of art this week.

It’s mainly marketing. — The cost of shopping cart staples has risen nearly 29% since before the pandemic. But big grocery stores hope a brief holiday inflation break will earn faithful shoppers—and some are eating the cost to make it happen. While the wholesale price of a frozen turkey clocks in at $1.73 per pound right now, it’s retailing at places like Walmart for $0.97 per pound: • Aldi announced a $40 bundle that includes a 14-pound turkey and traditional fixings to feed 10 people, a $7 drop from what it offered last year. • Walmart, which bundled its first holiday dinner four years ago, is keeping its deal at the same price as last year—around $4 per person for a table of 10—but has removed some items from its 2024 meal. Big picture: — The American Farm Bureau Federation priced the classic dinner at $55.18 for a party of 10 this year (based on wholesale prices, not retail bundles).

19a9bbb535ceba76_2,The crypto market is melting,"Like painstakingly simmering a perfect cheese roux only to immediately drop the container all over the kitchen floor on the way to the fridge, bitcoin has erased nearly a year’s worth of work in just six weeks. Crypto exploded in late 2024, pushing bitcoin past $100,000 on the promise of the Trump presidency being friendly to the industry. But even now, with loosened regulations and a pro-crypto SEC chair, the market has lost over $1 trillion in the last month and a half, leaving it essentially flat from last year. Monday, the cryptocurrency had dropped below $90,000: • The last time bitcoin fell under that threshold was when President Trump announced his first tariff plan in April (it dropped to ~$74,400). • The slide from its peak last month to yesterday’s $93,000 marks a 26% decline, putting it in what Wall Street considers a bear market. Why the implosion? Investors are growing nervous about a potential AI bubble and selling off riskier, more speculative assets—like crypto. More and more execs and analysts are sounding the alarm about overvalued AI stocks, especially as companies like OpenAI and Nvidia are caught in a multibillion-dollar spending loop . More broadly, the market is still struggling to recover from the Trump administration’s earlier threats to place new tariffs on Chinese imports, even though a one-year “trade truce” between the US and China was announced at the end of October. The Oct. 10 announcement led to a record liquidation of nearly $19 billion , according to CoinGlass. Big picture: — The stock market hasn’t escaped the ongoing wipeout. The S&P 500 fell for a fourth straight trading session yesterday, as investors grow pessimistic that the Fed will lower interest rates in December. Much will hinge on Nvidia’s earnings report today and the long-delayed September jobs report tomorrow. —MM",2025-11-19 10:38:10

The president also praised the crown prince’s human rights record, which Amnesty International has characterized as “an unprecedented crackdown on freedom of expression.” Today, Saudi Arabia is set to announce several deals with US companies, including Amazon and xAI, according to Semafor. —AE",2025-11-19 10:38:10
19a9bbb535ceba76_6,Home Depot isn’t doing so hot,"The roof is leaking and the walls are starting to smell like mold (metaphorically speaking) at the Disney World for dads. Home Depot released Q3 earnings yesterday that showed sales stagnated, which it attributed to high interest rates, shaky consumer confidence, and fewer-than-usual fall storms that thwarted an anticipated rebound in renovation. The lackluster report marks the third consecutive quarter of missed earnings expectations. The retailer’s stock closed down 6% yesterday. Other details that troubled investors include: • Home Depot’s sales at US stores open for at least a year increased 0.2% last quarter from the same period in 2024, less than the 1.4% analysts expected. • The company projected that its 2025 adjusted earnings per share, a key measure of profitability, would decline 5% from last year, a bigger drop than the 2% previously projected. Grim backdrop Though interest rates came down this year, they’re still high enough to prevent people from buying new homes with awful carpeting they want to tear out and replace, or from undertaking renovations on their existing dwellings. Plus, Home Depot said jitters related to the government shutdown and accelerating layoffs might also give people pause when it comes to costly home remodeling. Big picture: — Target’s earnings report will be released before the market opens today, and Walmart’s will come out tomorrow. Together, they’ll shed more light on whether shoppers are tightening their belts due to broader economic conditions. —SK",2025-11-19 10:38:10
19a9bbb535ceba76_7,Panera’s baking a new plan to earn more bread,"With sales stagnating, Panera Brands CEO Paul Carbone unveiled a bold plan yesterday to win back customers: make everything better. Panera, once considered the gold standard in American fast-casual dining, has fallen behind competitors like Chipotle and Panda Express, with its sales dropping 5% to $6.1 billion last year. Carbone says the goal is to reach $7 billion in annual sales by 2028 behind “Panera RISE,” a new strategy intended to undo the chain’s cost-cutting measures, which he dubbed “death by a thousand paper cuts.” The overhaul includes: • Lettuce: — Salads will be fully romaine again and no longer include iceberg. “No one likes iceberg,” said Carbone, who also may have been delivering a four-word review of Titanic . Salads will also have eight ingredients instead of the current five. • Tomatoes: — Starting next year, salads will contain sliced cherry tomatoes (rather than whole ones that were used to save money). • Drinks: — Frescas and “energy refresher” drinks (which have less caffeine than the ones that resulted in two wrongful death lawsuits ) are in the offing. • Portions: — The WSJ reports that Panera is “beefing up portions” after shrinking its sandwiches. • Labor: — There will be more workers on hand, and the company is reinvesting in the self-ordering kiosks that haven’t been upgraded in nearly a decade. Zoom out: — Panera is also looking to mimic the value offerings at establishments like Chili’s, but lacks appetizer options. “We haven’t cracked the code yet,” Carbone said. —DL",2025-11-19 10:38:10
19a9bbb535ceba76_8,Prime number: “Baby Shark” shares jump 62%,"The song that makes parents around the world stare into the middle distance and contemplate their life choices is officially on the stock market. Pinkfong, the South Korean company responsible for “Baby Shark,” went public on the Kosdaq market of the Korea Exchange this week, spiking as much as 62% and closing Tuesday with a market value of about $406 million, Bloomberg reported. Depending on whom you ask, “Baby Shark” is either a catchy tune for tykes that keeps them occupied so their parents can feed themselves, or the most nightmarish screeching known to humankind that must be destroyed posthaste. Either way, it’s historically popular: • “Baby Shark Dance” is YouTube’s most-watched video ever, with more than 16 billion views. • The song has even made it onto Billboard’s Hot 100 and was at one point No. 1 on Spotify’s Global Viral 50 chart. And yet, it might not make Pinkfong as much money as you’d think. Due to YouTube’s restrictions on monetizing kids’ content, the company generated only about $67 million in total revenue last year—part of the reason it’s now hoping investors will help it level up. —AE",2025-11-19 10:38:10

Bloomberg reported yesterday that job seekers are jostling for what are typically high-turnover roles that require physical and mental toughness, while not always paying well. For example: • Applications to the Georgia Department of Corrections were up 40% in the last three months compared to the same period last year. • The US military met its recruiting goals ahead of schedule this summer, after previously struggling to attract enlistees. Analysts say the recruitment rebound might be due to fewer alternative work options and pay raises. • Waste management recruiting firm HireQuest said that i​​its unit that staffs recycling and garbage facilities experienced a 50% surge in applications over the past two years, which the company attributes to higher interest and fewer vacancies. It happens when cubicle gigs are scarce Unlike people rewatching Sex and the City , the increased allure of unglamorous work can actually indicate economic challenges. While the economy was projected to grow at a solid clip of 3.9% in Q3, layoffs have accelerated and hiring has slowed for office workers—prompting economist to argue over how much AI is to blame. While private sector hiring recovered slightly last month, per data from payroll firm ADP, most onboarding occurred in non-office sectors like healthcare and construction. And the road ahead looks bumpy for people early in their careers, as employers are favoring workers with a few years of experience. Companies are more pessimistic about the upcoming spring college grad hiring season than they have been since the pandemic, according to a recent National Association of Colleges and Employers survey.

19a96a1b4fd5e79d_5,Trump says he would sign the bill to release Epstein files if it passes,"With the House poised to vote on a bill to force the Justice Department to release its files on the late sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein this week, President Trump told reporters yesterday he’d sign it , though he also said, “The whole thing is a hoax.” The president had opposed such a release for months and had urged lawmakers to reject the bill, but on Sunday, he abruptly shifted his position, saying on Truth Social that Republicans should support it. Trump’s change of heart led more Republicans to publicly support the bipartisan measure yesterday, according to Politico. Meanwhile, former Treasury Secretary and former Harvard President Larry Summers is stepping back from his public commitments after his emails with Epstein were made public. —AR",2025-11-18 10:51:55
19a96a1b4fd5e79d_6,CEO again: Bezos is leading his new AI company,"Four years after stepping down as CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos is ready to lead another company. Well, at least co-lead—the New York Times reported yesterday that Bezos is the co-founder and co-CEO of Project Prometheus, a $6.2 billion AI startup that he’s partially funding. Bezos is sharing the leadership roles with Vik Bajaj, a physicist and chemist who worked at Google’s “Moonshot Factory,” which was known for its attempts at ambitious technological breakthroughs. Per the NYT, the extremely well-funded Project Prometheus aims to build AI models that learn in more complex ways than the LLMs that power AI chatbots: • The company seems poised to join the competition to create world models. Such models can be taught to understand physical dimensions by getting spatial inputs or watching videos, while LLMs learn from text, which allows them to mimic human speech. • World models can aid in the creation of technologies, like robots and video games, and can also be applied in computer science, engineering, and aerospace. Hence, Bezos’s interest: — The founder of Blue Origin, the space exploration company that turned Katy Perry into an astronaut this year, wants to pursue the tech for engineering and manufacturing. What else is known? — Much like the 2012 movie of the same name, this Prometheus has left a lot of questions unanswered. The NYT reports that the company has ~100 employees, but the publication could not determine when it was founded or where it is based. But like any good startup, it has a LinkedIn page . —DL",2025-11-18 10:51:55
19a96a1b4fd5e79d_7,"Young diners want community, elbow room optional","Gen Z would love to eat dinner right next to you: In the name of human connection, young adults embraced the divisive trend of communal dining this year, according to Resy. Don’t be surprised if they revive hitchhiking next. The reservation company’s recent survey of 1,000 people who eat out in the US found that: • 90% of Gen Z diners said they like sitting at shared tables, compared to 60% of baby boomers, and probably 0% of Larry David. • Among fans of communal dining, 63% cited the possibility of meeting new friends or crushes as a major draw. Scoot over. — Gen Z is so sick of scrolling that the so-called anxious generation is willing to risk personal space and awkward small talk to build real-life community. For many, a forced group setting likely makes socializing less intimidating than, say, asking your neighbor to grab coffee (see also: the rise of supper clubs , run clubs , and apps for IRL stranger meet-ups ). Also… — communal plates are in, since it’s often less financially painful to go family style on appetizers and entrees, whether you’re splitting with loved ones or strangers (brave). More than 94% of diners—and 97% of Gen Z—surveyed by Resy said they’re likely to share food when dining out. —ML",2025-11-18 10:51:55
19a96a1b4fd5e79d_8,Prime number: Fewer foreign students,"Students at US universities this fall had a slimmer chance of being paired with a foreign roommate who brought exciting snacks to share from their home country. American institutions of higher learning enrolled 17% fewer new international students this school year, according to data released by the Institute of International Education. The group’s survey of 825 schools found: • Overall, the total number of international students decreased by 1%, with undergraduate enrollment actually rising by 2%, but enrollment in graduate programs dropping by 12%. • Institutions still want international students: 84% of them consider international recruitment a priority. Some 81% of schools stressed the value of their unique perspectives, while 60% noted their financial contributions, as foreign students typically pay full tuition. The decline in international student enrollment comes after the Trump administration has tangled with universities over funding and ideological issues, and put up new barriers to studying in the US, including cracking down on student visas and increasing travel restrictions that can impact foreign students. But President Trump recently said allowing foreign students was a “good” practice that was important to schools “as a business.” And, despite the dip, the US remains the top destination globally for international students, per Bloomberg. —AR",2025-11-18 10:51:55

19a918c788c27fb2_2,"As demand for films lags, microdramas emerge","The new frontier of video entertainment is the microdrama, where the plots are wildly contrived and quality absolutely does not matter. A crash course in cutting-edge media. — Microdramas are mobile-first episodic narratives filmed in vertical format, like a TikTok or Instagram Reels. They are essentially feature films shot for around $200,000 total and then divided into ~2-minute installments: • Viewers can binge a few “episodes” before being prompted to sign up for an account at a specific microdrama app. In the US, the leading contenders are DramaBox, FlareFlow, and ReelShort. • The business model echoes that of “freemium” mobile games. To advance through the narratives, viewers have to watch ads or make in-app purchases. Hollywood invasion The format took off in China—where it’s called “duanju”—and made $7 billion last year, surpassing the country’s domestic box office for the first time, according to Variety. In 2024, US revenue for microdrama reached $819 million, which is projected to rise to $3.8 billion by 2030, according to Variety. That’s less than half of what the US box office brought in last year. But Hollywood could use all the supplemental income it can get: • Last week, the New York Times reported that none of the 25 dramas released in North America over the last three months has become a hit. • Even well-reviewed, high-quality movies featuring renowned stars can’t get traction. Jennifer Lawrence’s Die My Love brought in $2.8 million in ticket sales during its debut weekend. After the Hunt , starring Julia Roberts, made $3.3 million after a month of playing in the US and Canada. Microdramas eschew big names and heavy production values, and rely on workaday actors and writers. “It’s really saving a lot of people’s bacon ,” Nick Ritacco told Variety. He’s starred in 40 microdramas. But it may upend Tinseltown: — Microdrama work is nonunion, and the production companies behind it proudly use AI to keep content flowing at rapid rates. The genre will probably never get its own Oscar category. Puck News called microdramas “the street drug of the content economy.”— HVL",2025-11-17 11:08:00

Will Travis Kelce’s mom show some skin? “Prop bets”—wagers on specific events within a game—can be silly or downright ridiculous, but, according to the Wall Street Journal, they’re a major driver of gambling revenue …along with being a major source of heartburn for sports leagues. Easier to fix: — Since prop bets often only involve one player—rather than a whole team—they’re easier to rig. For example: • NBA players Terry Rozier and Jontay Porter are accused of leaving games early to make sure their stats stayed below a certain level, having tipped off bettors beforehand. • Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz were recently indicted for telling bettors when they would throw certain pitches. Leagues are trying to quell controversies and prevent similar scandals so fans don’t lose faith in the integrity of the sports and direct their eyeballs elsewhere. The NBA is considering changing how players report injuries , and the MLB is working to limit bets on individual pitches. Harder to fix: — But changes can be a tough sell to sportsbooks, which use prop bets to incentivize users to place higher-paying parlays, which include multiple bets (and more chances to lose).

19a872dae12e2822_2,Trump gives some groceries a tariff discount,"The White House is trying to address the phenomenon of shoppers sounding like their grandparents reminiscing about when a gallon of milk was a nickel. Yesterday, President Trump signed an executive order to scrap his “reciprocal” tariffs on coffee, beef, avocados, nuts, tomatoes, and dozens of other grocery staples in a bid to lower food prices that have been squeezing consumers. The order exempts hundreds of products from the sweeping tariffs that Trump imposed on almost every US trading partner. It comes after the administration negotiated framework deals with Ecuador, Guatemala, Argentina, and El Salvador this week that include lowering tariffs on products that can’t be grown or produced at a sufficient scale in the US, including coffee and bananas. Political analysts note… — that these moves come a week after Democrats won big in several local elections after running campaigns focused on affordability . Prices are bananas Economists say tariffs can play a role in making grocery staples pricier. The average price of bananas—a tropical import previously considered reliably dirt cheap compared to other fruit—was up 7% in September from 12 months prior. Punishing import duties on the agricultural powerhouse Brazil were also significant: • The price of coffee rose 19% in the year leading up to September. Adverse weather conditions contributed, as did a 50% tariff on Brazil’s exports, which accounted for about a third of the US’ supply as of 2023. • Beef prices shot up 50% over the same period, according to government data. Cattle shortages in the US were largely to blame, but with imports needed to supplement, there was a 76% tariff rate on cow meat from Brazil, the world’s largest beef exporter. Because yesterday’s order will remove Trump’s reciprocal tariffs aimed at tackling trade imbalances, it won’t impact additional tariffs levied over Trump’s objection to Brazil’s prosecution of its former president, and will therefore reduce tariffs on Brazilian farm products by just 10%, an administration official told Bloomberg. But… — the administration denies that tariffs are causing ballooning grocery prices, instead blaming spending by the Biden administration. Still, officials say they hope that lowering some tariffs will allow American businesses to pass on savings to shoppers. —SK",2025-11-15 10:52:09

The decision on the latest plan comes after the Supreme Court rejected an earlier version because it let the Sackler family entirely off the hook for future opioid-related claims, even though some plaintiffs had not agreed to the settlement. In the new version, the Sacklers will contribute up to $7 billion over 15 years, and creditors who do not consent to the deal can still sue in civil court. —AR",2025-11-15 10:52:09
19a872dae12e2822_6,Vine is (kind of) back from the dead,"Hold on to your croissant . After a nearly nine-year hiatus, short-form video platform Vine is back. A new version of the app , called diVine, has resurrected a slew of old clips and creator profiles in an attempt to relive some of that mid-2010s magic, six seconds at a time. DiVine intervention: — It’s not a full resuscitation. There were terabytes of data withering in the Vine archives, but they weren’t easily accessible, so diVine founder Evan Henshaw-Plath reconstructed what he could. He told TechCrunch that diVine will have about 150,000–200,000 Vine videos from ~60,000 creators (for comparison, old Vine had a few million creators). DiVine users will also be able to post new videos, and creators can remove any of their old videos that got reposted. Back in the loop: — Henshaw-Plath, an original Twitter employee, has financial backing from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s nonprofit “and Other Stuff.” Dorsey, who shut down Vine in 2017, previously said that was his “biggest regret.” Current Twitter X owner Elon Musk announced in August that he also planned to revive Vine, but that hasn’t happened so far. Slop-free zone: — DiVine will screen for and block generative AI content, so the app can focus on human-powered connection. Cat soap opera lovers will have to get their fix elsewhere.— BC",2025-11-15 10:52:09

19a81fd9ac6e889e_2,Starbucks strike aims to disrupt holiday coffee rush,"On one of the busiest days of the year for the world’s largest coffee house, unionized workers commenced an open-ended strike yesterday that could snowball into their biggest one yet. More than 1,000 Starbucks baristas walked out in an attempt to muddle the chain’s popular Red Cup Day and gain leverage in stalled contract negotiations. According to Starbucks Workers United: • Strikes were planned for more than 65 locations in 45 cities, including New York and Seattle. • More baristas across 550 total unionized locations are prepared to join the picket line if Starbucks and the union don’t reach an agreement. So far, Starbucks said any impact is negligible: As of late yesterday morning, a spokesperson told CNBC that the chain was on track to surpass its sales expectations for Red Cup Day, an annual promo in which customers get a free reusable cup for ordering a seasonal drink. The company said that past strikes—some of which also targeted Red Cup Day—have impacted less than 1% of its nearly 17,000 US locations. But… — the union said it’s willing to make this “the largest, longest strike in company history,” with no end date currently set. If the strike continues deeper into the season of mocha lattes and Hallmark movies, it could spoil Starbucks’ holiday sales bump… …and derail its turnaround plan The strike comes after Starbucks closed hundreds of stores in September, including 59 unionized locations, as part of a broader restructuring under new CEO Brian Niccol. After being brought on late last year to revitalize the frappuccino maker, Niccol recently helped to break the chain’s two-year streak of sales declines, delivering 1% milk growth in its most recent quarter. Labor tensions worry some investors: — Last month, a group of Starbucks shareholders urged the company’s board to resume contract negotiations before the union dispute affects its stock price. Starbucks said yesterday that it’s ready to return to the table whenever. In April, the union overwhelmingly rejected Starbucks’ latest proposal for 2% annual raises. —ML",2025-11-14 10:39:18

19a81fd9ac6e889e_6,Low-potency cannabis is illegal again,"Folks in states without legal weed might have to watch Family Guy sober, since weaker alternatives won’t be available at their local gas stations. The shutdown-ending funding bill that Congress passed this week will re-criminalize intoxicating hemp to the dismay of the $28 billion industry. The law closes a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that allowed the sale of products containing less than 0.3% of THC, aka the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Legal 180 Lawmakers argued that psychoactive hemp is under-regulated and puts young people at risk since it is often sold without proper disclosures and can be chemically altered for stronger potency. Last month, 38 state attorneys general—including some from states with legalized recreational marijuana—asked Congress to ban high-inducing hemp. When the measure kicks in a year from now: • The sale of any product containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container will be federally illegal. • Products affected include hemp gummies, joints, Delta-8, and THC-infused beverages, which have become increasingly popular as a booze alternative. It's not just stoners complaining… — with industry executives saying the ban would eliminate 95% of their sales. It endangers 300,000 jobs, according to hemp research firm Whitney Economics. Critics, meanwhile, argue that banning the products won’t stop people from getting high—they’ll just rely on unregulated products. —SK",2025-11-14 10:39:18

Yesterday, Apple introduced its newest low-tech release, the iPhone Pocket, and the internet’s reaction seems to be making fun of the phone tote and its high price tag. The small, knitted bag doesn’t have any zippers or clips, just a pocket that is designed to stretch around your phone and a few other everyday items. • The version with the shorter straps comes in eight colors and costs $149.95, while the crossbody bag comes in three colors and costs $229.95. • That’s wildly more expensive than the $29 multi-pack of iPod Socks from 2004 that Apple announced in response to expensive cases and even the well-reviewed $59 iPhone strap the company released in September. The pouch was designed in collaboration with Issey Miyake, the Japanese fashion label founded by the late designer of the same name, who made Steve Jobs’s iconic black mock turtlenecks.

President Trump’s directive to change the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War will cost up to $2 billion , NBC News reported, citing senior congressional staffers. The change is a lot more complicated than the average rebrand: • Thousands of signs, placards, letterheads, and other items at US military bases around the world need to be replaced. • All of the department’s digital code—including for external sites and internal, classified systems—must be rewritten. The move comes as Trump has pushed to cut back federal spending and Secretary of Defense War Pete Hegseth has said he plans to cut thousands of jobs at the Pentagon.
