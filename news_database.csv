19a4eb9435eaa367_2,"OpenAI, Amazon Sign $38 Billion Cloud Deal",OpenAI will pay Amazon $38 billion for computing power in a multiyear deal. Amazon expects all of the computing capacity negotiated as part of the agreement to be available by the end of the year. It wasn't able to sell its cloud services to OpenAI for years because OpenAI had an exclusive cloud-computing partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI is set to generate $13 billion in revenue this year. It will have to continue expanding sales at an exponential rate to pay for its computing needs. Sam Altman claims that OpenAI is facing severe computing shortages and that revenue will grow even faster as more capacity becomes available.

It uses a dedicated venture fund called Series X Capital to invest in its spinouts. The moonshot factory has a culture that celebrates killing off promising ideas.

19a4e89ad42c23ba_2,Kimberly-Clark is taking Tylenol in $49 billion deal,"Headaches be damned—Kimberly-Clark has struck a $48.7 billion deal to purchase Kenvue—the maker of Tylenol and a company spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023—in a takeover that would create the second-biggest proprietor of health and wellness products in the world. Kimberly-Clark is not only a great fake name to use while you’re on vacation: it’s the company responsible for making Huggies and Depend diapers, Kleenex tissues, and Cottonelle toilet paper. By joining forces with Kenvue and its well-known products, like the Johnson’s Baby line and Band-Aid, Kimberly-Clark expects to drive $32 billion in revenue annually. Legal and political issues abound While the Trump administration is amenable to mergers and acquisitions, the president in September promoted unfounded claims linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism, something Kenvue and many physician groups said research does not support . Tylenol sales, which Morningstar estimates are worth ~$1 billion a year, have since declined sharply . Plus, Kenvue’s legal troubles are poised to become Kimberly-Clark’s problem if the deal closes as expected in the second half of 2026: • Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton alleged in a lawsuit filed last week that the company hid evidence that linked Tylenol to neurodevelopmental disorders. It also claims that Kenvue was created to shield J&J from legal liability over the link, but the New York Times reports that the timeline doesn’t match the influx of lawsuits beginning in 2022 and the initial plan to make Kenvue its own entity in 2021. • Many lawsuits also claim that the talc formerly used in Johnson’s Baby Powder caused cancer. The terms of the spinoff have largely protected Kenvue in the US, but a similar lawsuit was recently filed in the UK. Zoom out: — Kenvue had been facing activist investor pressure to find a sale—its stock is down nearly 24% YTD even after jumping ~12% yesterday on the news that Kimberly-Clark was paying a 46% premium on its Friday closing price. Kimberly-Clark’s share price, on the other hand, dropped ~14% yesterday. —DL",2025-11-04 10:53:10

The companies inked the deal less than a week after OpenAI revised its agreement with Microsoft to let OpenAI get more computing resources without first offering the business to Microsoft.

In 2024, the company’s AI-made holiday spot prompted backlash, both for its uncanny valley dwelling AI-produced humans, and for the tech’s potential to take jobs away from the creative professionals who would otherwise be creating ad imagery.

19a4e89ad42c23ba_6,Billionaires brace for likely Mamdani win,"As New Yorkers head to the polls today to choose their next Rat Czar appointer, the city’s wealthiest inhabitants are facing the probable scenario of self-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani winning the mayoralty. New Yorkers who Uber without a second thought of high net worth, including Bill Ackman and Michael Bloomberg, as well as some wealthy out-of-towners like Alice Walton, poured millions into super PACs opposing Mamdani and backing his top opponent, Andrew Cuomo. (Republican Curtis Sliwa is also in the race.) Why the moneyed fear Mamdani Mamdani wants to pay for his proposals like free buses and universal child care by reaching into the city’s deepest pockets: • Mamdani proposed raising the top municipal income tax rate from 3.9% to 5.9% for New Yorkers making $1+ million per year—of which there were about 35,000 in 2023. • Many titans of industry are ideologically opposed to his policy wish list, which includes raising corporate taxes, implementing a rent freeze on 1 million apartments, and opening city-run grocery stores. Some wealthy New Yorkers claim that they’ll leave Mamdani’s NYC, which could hit city coffers, as top 1% earners account for two-fifths of the city’s income tax revenues. President Trump also endorsed Cuomo yesterday, saying that if Mamdani wins he’d be unlikely to send federal funds to NYC “other than the very minimum as required.” But… — Mamdani's tax-the-rich plan might not happen, even if he wins today’s election, since the state legislature—and not the mayor—sets NYC’s income taxes. —SK",2025-11-04 10:53:10
19a4e89ad42c23ba_7,Martha Stewart wants to be Gen Z’s Martha Stewart,"America’s favorite stockbroker-turned-lifestyle mogul rereleased her first book, Entertaining , today. Though there’s no new material in the reissue, reheating her own nachos for a new generation should be a piece of cake for Martha Stewart, who allegedly made flan in prison one time. Why relaunch? — Entertaining , originally published in 1982, has been out of print for years, but interest in the 300-recipe compendium that spawned Stewart’s business empire spiked last year, after CNN and Netflix both released documentaries about her. The book’s publisher said it decided to reissue the book (a rare move) after new young fans started elbowing for vintage editions: • Online resale prices recently ranged from $173 to $311, or $1,700+ for a shrink-wrapped version, according to the New York Times. • It took five eBay bidding wars for the popular cooking creator Meredith Hayden, aka Wishbone Kitchen , to secure a copy last year, she posted on TikTok. Two changes: — The Entertaining reissue is printed on nicer paper and costs $50, up from $35 originally. But every word is the same, including a dedication to Stewart’s now ex-husband and the use of “Oriental” to refer to Asian cuisine. New audience: — Stewart told the Washington Post that she thinks twenty-somethings will buy the reissue “because I’m cool. Not only can I cook, I hang out with Snoop Dogg and I have gone to jail. I have been through the wringer and come out alive.” —ML",2025-11-04 10:53:10

That’s baseball’s biggest audience since the Astros stole signs and cheated defeated the Dodgers in Game 7 of the 2017 World Series. And once international audiences are included for this year’s Game 7, you can expect an even more jaw-dropping overall total.

19a4949c75ce5b52_2,Signs of K-shaped economy popping up everywhere,"Recent earnings reports and consumer data show a bifurcation in the US that experts call a “ K-shaped ” economy. It means wealthy consumers do well and spend freely while lower- and middle-income people struggle and scrimp. In the US’ current market realities, that looks like: • The affluent doing very well along with the booming stock market and the appreciation of their homes in the inventory-crunched real estate market. • Nearly everyone else faltering due to a shaky job market, high interest rates, and/or inflation. Some of the sectors flashing “K” Auto: — In September, the cost of a new vehicle passed the $50,000 mark for the first time, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book. And repossession volume passing through Manheim, the auction group owned by Cox, was up 12% through the end of September on an annualized basis, according to the Wall Street Journal’s deep-dive into the rise of auto repos. Airlines: — Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said that sales of premium seats would exceed those of coach seats for at least one or two quarters in 2026. Food & bev: — Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told CNBC that sales of its premium brands, like Smartwater, Topo Chico, and Fairlife, are juicing the company’s sales, while Coke demand is up at dollar stores, as well as at amusement parks frequented by higher spenders. Consumer goods: — Apple grew by double digits last quarter, thanks to strong sales of the $799 iPhone 17. And while economist Leo Feler told Marketplace that “everyone has kept buying health and personal care items,” how and when they buy them has changed. Wealthier shoppers are making hauls at Costco, while budget-constrained shoppers use up everything at home before going shopping. Zoom out: — Economic trends suggest that the gap will widen rather than narrow. Economist Betsey Stevenson of the University of Michigan told Marketplace, “The real risk to a K-shaped economy is social and political instability.”— HVL",2025-11-03 10:26:33
19a4949c75ce5b52_3,"Government shutdown enters fifth week, with more consequences","More than 65,000 children are at risk of losing access to Head Start , the national childcare and early childhood learning program for low-income families, as more funding lapses hit centers in multiple states. Local Head Start programs receive their annual funding at different times of the year. Those that receive their annual budget on Oct. 1 have already been disrupted. Now, those scheduled to receive funding on Nov. 1 have been impacted, as will those with Dec. 1 funding dates if the shutdown continues. And yesterday, on CBS’s Face the Nation , Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that he would not fire air traffic controllers who do not show up to work without pay during the government shutdown, and “We will slow traffic down, you’ll see delays, we’ll have flights canceled to make sure the system is safe” if there aren’t enough ATCs to cover shifts. And on CNN’s State of the Union , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the Trump administration “could” make SNAP payments by Wednesday.

19a4949c75ce5b52_4,The Dodgers bested the Blue Jays to win the World Series,"It all came down to Game 7 on Saturday night in Toronto. With a tie in the ninth inning , the Dodgers called in relief pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who had pitched six innings the day before and had never before pitched on consecutive days as a professional. Yamamoto proceeded to throw a perfect defensive inning in the 10th and helped clinch the final outs in the 11th inning to secure victory for Los Angeles, 5–4, and the title. Yamamoto was named World Series MVP. After the game, fellow Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani said of Yamamoto, “I have no idea how he pulled it off. I really believe he is the No. 1 pitcher in the whole world.” The Dodgers will bring the Commissioner’s Trophy to the victory parade today in Los Angeles.

19a4949c75ce5b52_6,Amazon tries to sell normie brands at Whole Foods,"The Everything Store is looking for a more organic way to sell you junk food. Enter Whole Foods, the grocery chain that built its name on natural ingredients. Having its Berry Chantilly Cake and Little Debbies, too: — Amazon, which bought Whole Foods in 2017, doesn’t want to sully the chain’s clean-living reputation, but it also doesn’t want to miss out on Americans spending on groceries. So, it’s experimenting with ways to introduce mass-market brands, like cordoning them off to their own special section. According to the Wall Street Journal: • In one Philadelphia-area store, if customers crave something they can’t find, they can order it on the Amazon app, and a team of backroom robots will get it to them. • In Chicago, one store’s coffee shop and seating area were replaced by an “Amazon Grocery” kiosk reminiscent of a convenience store. More is in store: — Amazon, which has been working to more closely integrate its operations with Whole Foods, hasn’t said whether it’ll expand the experiments, but it’s definitely not done tweaking its grocery game. Amazon plans to launch its own private label grocery brand and expand same-day delivery of perishable food items to 2,300 cities by 2026.— BC",2025-11-03 10:26:33
19a4949c75ce5b52_7,The week ahead,"President Trump’s tariffs are before the Supreme Court: — Justices will hear arguments on Wednesday over whether the bulk of the president’s sweeping tariffs pass legal muster. The US Constitution says it’s up to Congress to set taxes and duties, but the White House argues that trade deficits with other countries are a national emergency, and that clears the way for the president to have broad tariff powers. If the court ends up ruling against the administration, it won’t wipe away all of Trump’s tariffs, but it could water down one of his most powerful trade weapons. Tesla shareholders will vote on Elon Musk’s massive new compensation package: — Shareholders will have a lot of zeroes to consider at Tesla’s annual meeting this Thursday. If approved, Musk’s new pay plan could be worth a trillion dollars if he hits certain ambitious milestones for the company. Board Chair Robyn Denholm has urged shareholders to green-light the massive compensation package, warning that Musk may leave Tesla if it’s not approved. The world’s biggest proxy firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, is among the groups recommending that shareholders vote against the pay plan. Election Day is Tuesday: — The Big Apple looms especially large in politics this week as democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani and former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo (running as an independent) vie for New York City mayor. Keep an eye on Republican Curtis Sliwa, who could play spoiler in the race, which has been billed as a fight for the future of the Democratic Party. Elsewhere in the country, gubernatorial races are taking place in New Jersey and Virginia, a redistricting measure is on the ballot in California, and a special election is being held in Texas to fill its 18th Congressional District. The district, which represents the Houston area, is predominantly Democratic.

19a4949c75ce5b52_8,Prime number: Berkshire’s monster $382b cash pile,"Warren Buffett has effectively turned Berkshire Hathaway’s books into Smaug’s lair. The conglomerate reported on Saturday that it had stockpiled $381.7 billion in cash—a company record— after another quarter of net selling equities and declining to buy back its own shares. The cash hoarding could indicate that Buffett is taking a more cautious approach to the current market, or that he’s simply waiting for a better opportunity to arise. The 95-year-old is also stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, and all of that cash will give his replacement, Greg Abel, a (Warren) buffet of options to chart his own course. That $381.7 billion is more than the combined market caps of Spotify, Robinhood, and DoorDash.

19a3ebeb7c6dceb9_2,This year’s ACA premium just got a lot more expensive,"Some 20 million Americans trying to enroll in marketplace insurance for 2026 are about to have their morning coffee ruined. Open enrollment for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act begins today, and most enrollees’ premiums are expected to jump by 26% on average, with some expected to more than double. What happened? Pandemic-era enhanced tax credits to lower premiums are expiring. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended those subsidies until the end of 2025. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend them further, meaning prices will rise for virtually all marketplace participants: • Approximately 22 million of the 24 million people enrolled in the marketplace receive these enhanced subsidies, which limit the percentage of their yearly income that they have to pay for health insurance. • These percentage limits are different based on income, so someone making $28,000 a year wouldn’t be required to spend more than $325 a year or about 1.2% of their annual income, according to the nonpartisan health policy group Kaiser Family Foundation. Without the subsidy, that amount rises to $1,562 . The government shutdown, which is now the second-longest in history, began over the loss of these subsidies. House Democrats would not support Republicans’ spending bill unless the credits were reinstated. And Republicans say they would be open to negotiating an extension of the subsidies if Democrats reopen the government, but not before. In the meantime, prices are going up. — The increase in healthcare premiums will vary from state to state and depend on age, with higher-income enrollees, older individuals, and those in rural areas expected to face steep hikes. But ultimately, no one is likely to escape a price increase. While many Republicans want the subsidies gone for good, calling them rife with fraud, some have warned that skyrocketing premiums could jeopardize the party’s success in the midterms.— MM",2025-11-01 09:18:57
19a3ebeb7c6dceb9_3,Court orders Trump administration to keep disbursing SNAP benefits,"A federal judge in Rhode Island yesterday ruled that the Trump administration must use contingency funds to continue paying out SNAP food assistance ASAP, as regular funding was due to run out today because of the government shutdown. A group of cities and nonprofits sued the federal government after it said it wouldn’t use the rainy day funds to keep SNAP funds flowing, arguing that the program no longer exists since Congress failed to fund it. In a separate case brought by several states, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled yesterday that the Trump administration’s plan to cease disbursing SNAP benefits was likely unlawful. The program provides food assistance to approximately 42 million lower-income Americans and costs the government around $8 billion per month. The $5 billion in emergency cash is expected to enable at least partial payments in the coming weeks.— SK",2025-11-01 09:18:57

It also reported that the FBI had been monitoring an online conversation in an ISIS chat room regarding the possibility of a terrorist attack over the weekend, but the plot was not concrete. In his statement, Patel said, “Through swift action and close coordination with our local partners, a potential act of terror was stopped before it could unfold.” Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, posted on X that Patel had briefed her.

As big as the Nile: — Billed as the world’s largest museum dedicated to one civilization, the facility covers the equivalent of about 80 football fields. According to CBS News, it took workers seven months just to excavate and remove sand to prepare the site . It also hit historic delays due to events including the Arab Spring and the pandemic, before soft-launching some parts of the museum last year. Pharaoh-minded: — The museum’s star attraction might be its complete collection of artifacts from King Tut’s tomb—all in one place for the first time since 1922. But it’s got around 100,000 other cool things, including: • A 53-foot-high Hanging Obelisk (the world’s only). • An 83-ton statue of King Ramses II that’s 3,200 years old. • A boat belonging to King Khufu, who built the Great Pyramid of Giza. Past and future: — Egypt is betting big on tourism, with officials aiming to double the number of international visitors by 2032, according to The Guardian.

19a39a0dab7be43f_2,The US obesity rate is declining amid GLP-1 use,"Gallup released a survey this week showing that the obesity rate among US adults has fallen to 37% this year, a significant drop from the record high of nearly 40% just three years ago. The decline comes as a growing number of Americans turn to GLP-1 drugs to lose weight. Gallup found that the use of these drugs specifically to lose weight (they’re also used to treat diabetes) has more than doubled from February 2024, when it was 5.8%, to 12.4% currently: • More women (15.2%) are taking the drugs than men (9.7%), which correlates with a slightly larger decline in obesity rates among women. • Adults in the 50-64 age range who took the survey had the highest usage of GLP-1s for weight loss, at 17%. The study illustrates how quickly these drugs have made their way into the mainstream—and how valuable they are for drugmakers. The battle over semaglutide Eli Lilly reported stellar third-quarter earnings yesterday and raised this year’s revenue estimates from $60 billion–$62 billion to $63 billion–$63.5 billion, crediting the growing adoption of its weight loss drugs Zepound and Mounjaro. The company also announced a direct-to-consumer partnership with Walmart, offering customers single-dose vials of Zepbound for under $500 in its pharmacies. Meanwhile, other pharma companies are desperately trying to claw back market share of obesity drugs, which is expected to reach $150 billion by 2030. Bidding war. — Novo Nordisk, the Danish creator of GLP-1s Wegovy and Ozempic, made an unsolicited offer to buy the weight loss drug developer Metsera for $9 billion. The offer followed shortly after Metsera struck a deal to sell itself to Novo’s rival, Pfizer, that was worth up to $7.3 billion (which Metsera can still get out of). Metsera is developing new GLP-1s, some of which can be taken less often than those currently on the market.— MM",2025-10-31 09:27:04
19a39a0dab7be43f_3,Federal judge “likely” to order the Trump admin to release SNAP funds,"On Thursday, Judge Indira Talwani said during a hearing that a $5.5 billion contingency fund should be used to provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits after states run out of aid money due to the government shutdown—lapses that may begin as soon as tomorrow. “Congress has put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency,” Talwani said. She also said the USDA should be figuring out how to allocate the $5.5 billion, even though it’s not enough money to fund an entire month of the program. She called the agency’s search for a reason not to disburse the money “lawyering” and said, “I want agency action, not lawyering.” The SNAP program provides food assistance to 42 million Americans.— HVL",2025-10-31 09:27:04

Earlier this week, The Hollywood Reporter said Sheridan was moving his overall pact from Paramount to NBCU, where his film deal will start next year and his TV deal will kick in in 2028.

In case you don’t have time to read all their securities filings, here are some standouts. In the Magnificent Seven: • Apple — and Amazon beat earnings expectations yesterday. Amazon’s cloud business grew faster than expected, while Apple’s iPhone revenue from China slightly underperformed. • Meta — hit a revenue record, but also announced plans to “aggressively” accelerate AI spending next year, scaring bubble-wary investors and obliterating $200+ billion in market value. • Microsoft — and Alphabet also beat expectations and upped their planned AI expenses. Microsoft’s stock shed a few points, but Alphabet’s went up. In retail: • Chipotle — cut its full-year guidance for the third straight quarter due to declining foot traffic. Its stock tanked 18% yesterday. • Hershey — said Halloween sales disappointed , but the company lifted its full-year forecast, citing tempering cocoa prices. • Crocs — lost less money than Wall Street feared. • Carvana — Used-car retailer logged a 44% increase in vehicle sales, possibly thanks to tariffs. • Visa — and MasterCard both beat earnings expectations on continued consumer spending .

19a39a0dab7be43f_7,Pentagon gets defensive about new Netflix movie,"The US military is addressing a newly identified threat: Kathryn Bigelow’s latest movie. A recent Pentagon internal memo disputed the accuracy of her Netflix thriller, A House of Dynamite, which revolves around (spoiler alert) a US defense system failing to intercept a nuclear missile headed for Chicago, Bloomberg reported. Without critiquing the mise-en-scène, the Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA) had a bone to pick with some of the film’s assumptions: • It challenged the premise that systems in Alaska and California designed to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles are only 61% accurate. • The memo claims that the film’s terrifying coin-flip odds estimate is dated and that there have been improvements, with recent tests showing 100% accuracy. What does the director say? Bigelow retorted that she consulted with ex-Pentagon officials for the movie. Military wonks, meanwhile, point out that only the last four tests of the system were successful, but there were three failures in the early 2010s. Plus, they say that two of the recent tests involved shorter-range missiles, which are easier targets than the intercontinental ballistic missile depicted in the movie. Everyone can agree… — that anti-missile tech is expensive, with the current Boeing-managed nuclear missile defense system costing, as of 2020, $53 billion plus another $10 billion in planned upgrades. And MDA plans to spend up to $151 billion building President Trump’s proposed “Golden Dome” missile shield. —SK",2025-10-31 09:27:04

The lowly copper-plated coin is disappearing from use—and it’s causing some headaches for US businesses. A number of merchants across the country have completely run out of pennies after the US government stopped making them earlier this year and failed to issue new guidance, the Associated Press reported: • Sheetz, the convenience store chain that Western Pennsylvanians swear is better than Wawa, ran a promotion offering customers a soda if they brought in 100 pennies. • Kwik Trip is rounding every cash transaction down to the nearest nickel, which will reportedly cost the company $3 million this year. The Treasury Department says the US will save about $56 million by no longer minting Abe Lincoln’s face, per the AP. Businesses are generally on board with the decision but want more clarity on how to proceed. “We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years,” a spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores told the AP. “But this is not the way we wanted it to go.” —AE",2025-10-31 09:27:04

19a34957462e3b7b_2,Fed cuts rates again but casts doubt on future slash,"Between a softening labor market and recent better-than-expected inflation data, economists considered yesterday’s interest rate cut to be as sure a bet as Giannis Antetokounmpo putting up 20+ points per game. They were right: The Federal Reserve slashed rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75% to 4.00%—their lowest level in three years. The real gamble is whatever the rate-setters do next. — When the Fed issued this year’s first cut in September , two more seemed likely. But analysts are less confident in lucky No. 3 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said yesterday that a December rate cut is “not a foregone conclusion, far from it.” “If there is a high level of uncertainty, then that could be an argument in favor of caution about moving,” Powell said, referencing the lack of economic data due to the government shutdown: • With employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics furloughed, monthly job reports are delayed indefinitely, depriving the Fed of one of its key barometers. • Yesterday’s decision relied on last week’s promising inflation data and some state-level metrics like unemployment claims, marking the first time a government shutdown forced the rate-setting committee to amend monetary policy without complete employment numbers. • Come December, the Fed might be working with even less information if the shutdown persists—consumer price data isn’t being collected right now, so the next inflation report might not get published, the White House recently warned. Another complication is that the girls are fighting. — For the first time since 2019, yesterday’s decision faced dissent on both sides: One Fed official wanted to hold rates steady, and another— recent appointee Stephen Miran—wanted a bigger cut. Committee members have “strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,” Powell said, as the Fed looks to strengthen the job market without spiking inflation from its current 3% rate. Separately… — the Fed also said it would stop shrinking its $6.6 trillion balance sheet, which it started trimming three years ago to prevent the economy from overheating. —ML",2025-10-30 09:55:19

Shares of the AI chip purveyor surged by 9% this week amid an AI conference it’s hosting in DC. While its execs rubbed elbows with Beltway bigwigs, Nvidia said it has $500 billion in chip orders and announced new collabs: • The company inked a $1 billion deal with Nokia to supply the maker of your third-grade flip phone with chips to develop 5G and 6G capabilities. • Nvidia said it’ll help the US Energy Department build seven new supercomputers. It all hinges on AI not being a bubble Nvidia’s fortunes are tied to those of the AI industry, which has been bingeing on the company’s semiconductors. If AI startups like OpenAI don’t live up to their valuations, analysts worry Nvidia could face the double whammy of fewer chip orders and the value of its stakes in these companies collapsing. There’s risk with all that growth: — Investors are profiting from Nvidia’s soaring stocks, but if Nvidia tanks, it could take the market with it.

Robotics company 1X announced preorders for Neo, which it claims is the “world’s first consumer-ready humanoid robot.” For $20,000—or a $499 per month rental fee and a six-month commitment—the lanky robot can do simple tasks around the house, such as unloading the dishwasher and watering plants, and can answer your questions through its built-in large language model. Unlike those sharp, metal military dogs that are always doing flips, Neo has a soft body and moves slowly. The bot can carry about 55 pounds and lasts for four hours on a single charge. Is Neo ready to become the Rosie of your family? — Well, sometimes it falls over, and it still needs a lot of human help. In fact, all of the tasks Neo performed in a test run with a reporter from the Wall Street Journal weren’t done autonomously.

19a2f548018e027b_2,"Amazon, UPS, PwC, and others slash workforces","That “support” reaction on LinkedIn is about to get its money’s worth. Amazon announced 14,000 corporate job cuts yesterday, with a total of 30,000 layoffs (~10% of its white-collar workforce) expected in the near future. UPS also said yesterday during its Q3 earnings call that it cut 48,000 positions this year already, with 14,000 of those coming from management roles. The huge headcount reductions follow a startling trend of mass layoffs in corporate offices around the US in recent weeks, including: • Ed tech company Chegg said it’s laying off 45% of its workforce, or 388 employees. Chegg blamed weak search traffic, which it in turn blamed on AI. • Paramount said it would lay off 1,000 employees starting today, with more expected following the merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media in August. • Target started its biggest round of layoffs in 10 years yesterday, which will cut 1,000 workers and 800 open positions—equivalent to 8% of the retailer’s workforce. • PwC cut its headcount by 5,600 in the last year leading up to June 30. The accounting firm originally promised in 2021 to increase hiring by adding 100,000 employees by mid-2026. Reasons companies are giving for slashing headcount include cutting costs, making workflows more nimble, or, in Amazon’s case, reducing bureaucracy. But some of the biggest cuts hint at executives hoping to free up funds for future AI spending. Some are being very open about it. — Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wants to turn the company into a lean, AI-equipped machine that operates like the “ world’s largest startup .” In July, Amazon reported that most of its $31.4 billion in Q2 capital expenditures were going to AI and cloud-computing investments, and that the trend would likely continue in future quarters. Big picture: — Despite all these layoffs, the private sector still added 14,250 jobs per week over the last month, according to early data from ADP. —MM",2025-10-29 09:27:03
19a2f548018e027b_3,Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5,"The historic storm barreled into Jamaica on Wednesday morning with wind speeds of 185 mph, making it the most powerful hurricane ever to hit the country.

Officials said that many Jamaicans ignored evacuation orders, with less than half of the country’s 800 shelters occupied as of yesterday, the New York Times reported. Because of power outages and other issues caused by the storm, it may be difficult to immediately know the extent of the damage and loss of life.

One of the loudest voices on the topic shifted his ideology ahead of next month’s United Nations climate summit: • Gates wants the world to focus less on (but not ignore) near-term problems like rising temperatures and the increasing number of extreme weather events, and more on humanitarian efforts in developing parts of the world. • The billionaire is asking those attending the summit to consider investing in climate adaptation, meaning “the areas where finance can do the most to fight poverty and boost health.” Why not both? — Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, didn’t mince words to the Associated Press. “There is no reason to pit poverty reduction versus climate transformation,” he argued. “Both are utterly feasible.” Shifting funds: — Gates has redirected charitable funds to poverty-stricken nations in need of assistance after President Trump slashed foreign aid budgets and shut down USAID in July.

This week, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, launched the beta version of Grokipedia to challenge Wikipedia. The new site reflects the political views of Musk, who, along with other conservatives, as well as one of Wikipedia’s co-founders, has accused the free encyclopedia of left-wing bias. Grok vs. Wiki Unlike Wikipedia’s 7+ million English-language articles written and edited by human volunteers, Grokipedia’s almost 900,000 entries are fact-checked by Grok, xAI’s chatbot. Users have noticed discrepancies in how the two sites address polarizing topics. For instance: • The Wikipedia article for the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack describes it as an “attempted self-coup ” and an attack by “a mob” to prevent the formalizing of then-President-elect Joe Biden ’s victory. • Meanwhile, Grokipedia says it was a “riot” protesting the certification of election results “amid widespread claims of voting irregularities” and cites sources claiming that it doesn’t qualify as an insurrection. But Grokipedia acknowledges drawing content from Wikipedia, with some of its articles, like the one for PlayStation 5, being a near carbon copy of the original.

OpenAI’s report comes as the company faces increased scrutiny over its handling of mental health, including a high-profile lawsuit accusing the ChatGPT-maker of contributing to a teenager’s suicide.

19a2a46f309c1829_2,SNAP and other benefits might lapse due to shutdown,"As the government shutdown turns 28 days old, its impact is quickly spreading beyond the rising number of federal employees missing paychecks. While the Trump administration previously moved money around to fund some federal programs until the end of the month, it recently said the SNAP food assistance relied on by over 40 million people won’t be funded starting on Nov. 1—which has never happened during a shutdown before. Some states plan to fund SNAP from their own coffers, but others warned residents to prepare for a lapse in benefits and advised them to turn to food banks. Also on Nov. 1: • Funding for some early childhood education and nutrition services that are part of the Head Start program is due to dry up, which could affect 59,000+ children nationwide. • Subsidies for commercial flights to rural areas might be cut off, forcing airlines to increase ticket prices. • Many Americans will face higher health insurance premiums due to the lapse of Obama-era healthcare subsidies axed in the Republican budget earlier this year—which, in large part, prompted the shutdown, as Democrats refused to pass government funding without extending them. Not fired, but unpaid Over 1.4 million federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay, with many due to miss their first paycheck of the shutdown this week, according to the Bipartisan Policy Institute. Many of Uncle Sam’s employees are picking up side gigs, like caring for pets and driving for ride-hailing apps, to carry themselves over, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, air traffic controllers—who are required to work without pay—have been calling out sick, leading to understaffed airport towers and skyrocketing flight delays. Pressure is mounting: — The largest federal worker union, which represents more than 800,000 members, called on lawmakers to put aside partisanship and pass a government funding bill that would get the direct deposits flowing again. —SK",2025-10-28 09:53:18

The shortcut of submitting prompts and receiving text from a chatbot has potential benefits for both reviewers and reviewees: • AI tools can reduce writing time by 40%, per Boston Consulting Group. So if it normally takes an hour to write vague goals and objectives for the following year, that’s 24 minutes right back into your pocket to focus on your office fantasy football league work. • Having more standardized feedback can reduce the perception of “playing favorites” or other biases, according to a management expert who spoke with Business Insider. Raise it: — Per FT, JPMorgan says AI can’t be used for salary decisions, and employees are ultimately responsible for final submissions, so copy and paste at your own risk. Banking on it: — CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg that the company’s $2 billion annual investment in AI has already paid for itself and has been used to trim headcount.

Bloomberg reported yesterday that ultra-wealthy Americans are taking full advantage of a new rule in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that allows them to completely write off certain high-value assets. ICYMI: — President Trump’s landmark legislation expanded a tax break known as bonus depreciation, which now lets business owners deduct 100% of certain purchases from their taxable income. Eligible splurges include yachts, cars, racehorses, and private jets—as long as they’re used for business more than half of the time. Demand is climbing: • Sales of private jets are up by 11% from this time last year, according to data from the jet broker Global Charter. • Horse sales at the world’s largest thoroughbred auction in Kentucky grew by 24% last month compared to 2024. Gas stations and car washes also qualify. — Sales of these establishments spiked after Trump temporarily expanded bonus depreciation in 2017. One entrepreneur told Bloomberg that he avoided millions of dollars in taxes by buying several car washes, which offset income from the sale of his family business. Looking ahead… — this rule will cost the IRS $363 billion in lost revenue over the next decade, according to estimates by Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. —ML",2025-10-28 09:53:18

The poll, conducted in July, showed: • About 23% of respondents said they were extremely or very confident they could afford to buy a home, compared with 11% for today’s children. • Meanwhile, 32% said they believe they can keep up with their expenses, while just 14% thought that the children can. And the younger generation agrees. — Compared to respondents aged 30+, a smaller share of those aged 18–29 felt confident they could: keep up with expenses, buy a car, pay for an unexpected medical expense, or have enough savings for retirement.

What is going on up there? To get the attention of US audiences, Doug Ford, the Conservative premier of Ontario, commissioned an ad featuring audio from a 1987 speech in which then-President Ronald Reagan said he didn’t like implementing tariffs because they “hurt every American worker and consumer.” The government of Ontario planned to spend $75 million broadcasting it to the States. Then, the Toronto Blue Jays, based in Ontario, punched their ticket to the World Series, making the province a bit more relevant than usual to Americans. The ad displeased the president. — On Friday morning, President Trump took to Truth Social to condemn the commercial , saying it misrepresented Reagan’s position on tariffs and that it was meant to influence the Supreme Court before a hearing on the legality of many of Trump’s tariffs next month. An escalating series of events followed: • President Trump halted all trade talks with Canada over the ad. • Premier Ford said he had spoken to Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is actually in charge of Canada, and as a result, he would pause the commercial on Monday… • …But that meant it aired during the World Series games on Friday and Saturday nights. • In retaliation, Trump announced a new 10% tariff on Canada. Ad(d) it all up: — The US already has a 35% general tariff on Canada, but the actual duty level can depend on the type of goods or whether they comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Now what? — Carney and Trump will be in Malaysia for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit this week.

Who? — PopUp Bagels began as a pandemic project in Connecticut and achieved virality on TikTok. It offers smaller, fluffier bagels and encourages patrons to “grip it, rip it, and dip it” rather than slice. B(re)aking new ground According to Bloomberg, a successful national bagel chain hasn’t taken hold because the bagel biz is labor-intensive and low-margin. The biggest player is Einstein Bros. Bagels, which operates around 600 stores in the US. PopUp plans to open 300 locations in the next four years, and it thinks it can go mainstream with: • Better margins. The minimum order is three bagels and a container of schmear, which costs between $13 and $17. • A “barebones” business model. Locations have a small footprint with minimal seating.

Consumer prices for lunchmeats experienced the largest monthly increase on record in September—4.2%—according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data reported by Bloomberg. While last year’s listeria recalls battered the sector, its current woes are more directly attributable to record US beef prices, smaller domestic pig and cattle herds, a worker shortage, and President Trump’s 50% tariff on imports from Brazil. “Everybody has to raise prices along the food chain,” American Association of Meat Processors Spokesman Sam Gazdziak told Bloomberg. “It has a ripple effect.”— HVL",2025-10-27 09:31:11

19a1ad2334a01b1c_2,Inflation is not as high as feared,"The biggest slasher this month will likely be Jerome Powell since the inflation data the government released yesterday wasn’t as scary as projected, which is expected to keep the Fed on track to cut interest rates. Consumer prices rose a relatively tame 0.3% for the month in September and 3% year over year. That’s below the 0.4% monthly inflation growth and 3.1% annual rise analysts had predicted. The inflation report is the only recent government economic data the Fed has to inform its interest rate decision next week, since most of Uncle Sam’s number crunchers are on leave due to the shutdown. And investors are betting that the not-so-bad consumer prices report will put the Fed at ease about the potential impacts of cutting interest rates on inflation, allowing the central bank to focus on stimulating the anemic job market by lowering borrowing costs. Better doesn’t mean good Just because prices didn’t pop as much as economic wonks predicted, it doesn’t mean shoppers aren’t getting hit with sticker shock as inflation remains well above the Fed’s 2% annual goal. Some price tags could be causing nostalgia for shopping in 2024: • Coffee and beef prices rose 19% and 15%, respectively, in the year leading up to September, largely due to weather-related supply disruptions, as well as the impact of tariffs. Meanwhile, bananas, which were long considered inflation-proof, have become 5.4% pricier since April, a trend economists attribute to tariffs. • Gardening services cost 14% more than in 2024, while repairing a car became 12% more expensive. And it may get worse: — Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi expects tariffs to accelerate price growth in the coming months, with businesses passing on the cost of import duties to consumers for goods like furniture and appliances. Looking ahead… — there’ll probably be no inflation… report from the government next month due to the shutdown, the White House said. That means the Fed will have to rely on private-sector data for its last interest rate meeting of the year in December. —SK",2025-10-25 10:53:22

Trump called the ad, which was released by the province of Ontario, “FAKE,” and said it was meant to interfere with the US Supreme Court case over the legality of the tariffs. The ad features real audio from parts of a speech given by former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs (though Reagan was defending his own decision to place tariffs on Japan).

Mico (pronounced me-ko) is now accessible in the US through Microsoft Copilot’s voice mode: • When you’re speaking, Mico nods its head and makes facial expressions based on the vibe of your sentence (exciting, sad, etc.), before responding in Copilot’s convincingly real voice. • Mico will tap a new “deeper memory” feature on Copilot that keeps track of information you mentioned in old conversations. • In a bid to steal students away from ChatGPT, Copilot’s new Learn Live mode turns Mico into a tutor that explains concepts orally and with visuals. “Clippy walked so Mico could run,” — Jacob Andreou, a product and growth VP at Microsoft AI, said on the TBPN podcast this week. The jog is happening on a tightrope: — Microsoft’s rollout of its more personable AI comes after federal regulators sent letters last month to Alphabet, Meta, Snap, Character Technologies, OpenAI, and xAI to inquire about safeguards for child users.

Two massive gambling busts are ripping through the NBA just as its regular season begins this week: The FBI arrested Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, former player and coach Damon Jones, and Portland Trail Blazers Head Coach Chauncey Billups yesterday for allegedly participating in two illegal gambling operations. First, the insider trading allegations… — prosecutors allege that Rozier and Jones provided nonpublic information like players’ injuries to individuals who would then place prop bets on games: • In one instance, Rozier and a co-conspirator allegedly split hundreds of thousands of dollars from a bet the individual made after Rozier told them he would leave the game early because of an injury: • The indictment also accuses Jones of leaking the injury status of LeBron James before a February 2023 game. • Federal officials claim that bets were placed on the Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Lakers, and the Toronto Raptors, which an official mistakenly referred to as the “ Toronto Rangers ” in a press conference. But the wildest allegations come from the second case. — Prosecutors say a mafia-linked illegal poker game got Billups and Jones to act as celebrity players to attract victims to be swindled out of their money. The games were rigged with table X-ray machines, secret cameras in card trays, and a card shuffler machine that fed info to someone behind the scenes. Players in the scheme also allegedly wore contact lenses and glasses that enabled them to read pre-marked cards. Not a great look as the NBA cozies up to gambling companies. — More than 30 people were arrested in 11 states yesterday, and FBI Director Kash Patel said tens of millions of dollars were stolen over the course of the scams. The NBA, which has partnerships with betting companies like FanDuel and DraftKings, said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were placed on immediate leave from the league. Rozier’s lawyers said he would fight the charges and that the FBI publicly arrested him for a “photo op.” Jones and Billups have yet to release statements. —MM",2025-10-24 10:39:11

In recent years, the company has tried to appeal to new users by expanding into comedy, sports, and cooking.

19a1086e02ec2ecb_2,NHL gives pro sports blessing to prediction markets,"Prediction markets don’t need luck, they are having an incredible month without it. Yesterday, the National Hockey League announced a multi-year deal with Polymarket and Kalshi that will allow both startups to use the league’s data and logos on their platforms. The deal marks the first partnership between a major US sports league and prediction markets, giving a pro sports seal of approval to upstarts that are challenging traditional sportsbooks. A big game Kalshi and Polymarket now have the NHL’s logo plastered all over their sites, but even without official recognition, they offer bets on other sports leagues’ games by using vague titles like “Pro football champion” and listing cities instead of specific team names. And while prediction markets let users bet on everything from how much the Fed will raise interest rates to when celebrities will break up, sports bettors flock to them: • Kalshi and Polymarket’s trading volume breached $2 billion for the first time last week following the start of the NFL season, eclipsing the previous volume record set during the US presidential election in 2024. • Sports-related bets accounted for $867 million of that trading on Kalshi and $415 million on Polymarket. Better odds: — Unlike traditional sportsbooks that are subject to a patchwork of local gambling regulations across the US, prediction markets—which facilitate betting contracts between users rather than acting as “the house” you bet against—are considered financial exchanges and regulated federally by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That’s allowed them to offer sports bets in states where gambling is illegal, leaving gaming commissions and state regulators pretty peeved. They’re tangling with prediction markets in court, and legal experts ultimately expect the companies’ ongoing ability to offer sports bets to be determined by the Supreme Court. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em: — This week, DraftKings acquired Railbird Technologies, a licensed prediction market exchange. Everyone wants a piece of predictions: — Kalshi is reportedly receiving funding offers that value it at more than $10 billion. And, the owner of the NYSE recently took a $2 billion stake in Polymarket.— MM",2025-10-23 10:53:05

Nonetheless, Elon Musk looked toward the future, stressing to investors that he expects to build AI, humanoid robots, and fully self-driving cars.

19a1086e02ec2ecb_6,No sign of economic rot in corporate earnings,"Corporate America might need a bigger rake for all the cash that’s coming its way. Though only 13% of S&P 500 companies have reported Q3 earnings so far, more than 85% of them have surpassed Wall Street’s expectations—the largest share to do so in over four years, per Bloomberg Intelligence. The upbeat earnings calls serve as an economic vibe check (albeit an incomplete one) that Wall Street and policy wonks are watching extra closely, since government data is limited as a result of the ongoing shutdown. So, who’s rolling in it? • General Motors boosted its earnings projections for 2025 from $10 billion–$12.5 billion to $12 billion–$13 billion. The automaker took a hit from tariffs and EV scalebacks, but enjoyed the best sales of its Silverado truck and Escalade SUV in the first three quarters since 2018 and 2007, respectively. • Coca-Cola’s Q3 net sales reached $12.46 billion, up 5% from the previous year. Units sold jumped by 1% from 2024 despite tariff-induced price hikes. The company was buoyed by growth in lower-calorie drink options like Coke Zero, though it said lower-income consumers are spending less. • Non-consumer brands—like oil services provider Halliburton, life sciences giant Danaher, and banking behemoth JPMorgan—also delivered blowout earnings. This might ease some concerns… — that stocks are overvalued amid the AI investment frenzy (which some call a bubble) and the recent collapse of two auto companies due to debt issues.

Bush’s and Barack Obama’s administrations. • Trump allies Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck. • Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Will.I.am, Sapiens author Yuval Noah Harari, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

19a0b53c4df59d67_2,‘Who want me?’ asks Warner Bros. Discovery,"The entertainment giant that’s part-Big Five Hollywood studio and part- Deadliest Catch is considering a sale after receiving interest from “multiple parties” that presumably stood outside its window with a boombox, Warner Bros. Discovery announced yesterday. The statement sent WBD stock to its highest point since the days after WarnerMedia and Discovery joined forces in 2022. In typical Hollywood fashion, that marriage is already coming undone: WBD said earlier this year that it plans to split into two entities—one for its coveted studios and streaming businesses like HBO Max, and another for lagging TV networks like CNN. One guy wants it all: — Fresh off his own merger , Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison (Larry’s son) is trying to buy WBD before it unmerges, but WBD CEO David Zaslav believes he can maximize shareholder value by selling each half separately, according to Bloomberg. Meet the potential suitors Paramount reportedly made multiple offers for WBD’s entire operation in recent weeks that were rejected for being too low. A successful bid would bring CNN under the same roof as CBS, which is now run by Bari Weiss following Paramount’s acquisition of The Free Press this month. Other possible bidders include: • Netflix. — Co-CEO Ted Sarandos has expressed interest in the iconic Warner Bros. studio and content library, though decidedly not its cable TV networks, Bloomberg reported. But Greg Peters, the other co-CEO, shrugged off the idea earlier this month. • Comcast. — The NBCUniversal owner, which is also spinning off some cable channels, is reportedly taking a look at WBD’s assets. • Apple and Amazon. — Executives and analysts expect tech companies like them to be enticed by the opportunity to snatch up HBO Max, though Apple exec Eddy Cue has thrown cold water on the idea of the iPhone-maker buying WBD. Zoom out: — WBD is keeping its options open, but the pool of interested parties suggests that the entertainment industry is likely headed for more consolidation. —ML",2025-10-22 10:39:06

19a0b53c4df59d67_6,Amazon wants robots to replace 600k future hires,"Amazon hopes it can use robots instead of poaching Dunder Mifflin’s Darryl. The e-commerce giant expects automation will help to avoid hiring 600,000 workers while it plans to double deliveries by 2033, according to internal documents the New York Times reported on yesterday. Robot-dominated warehouses may be imminent, as the documents suggest that: • Amazon plans to forego onboarding 160,000 humans in the US between 2025 and 2027. The company expects that this will save it 30 cents per item shipped, or $12.6 billion. • The robotics team ultimately aims to automate 75% of Amazon’s operations. Destroyers of jobs Nobel Prize-winning economist Daron Acemoglu told the NYT that automation could turn Amazon—currently the 2nd largest employer in the US—into “a net job destroyer.” He also predicted that Amazon’s move would cause its rivals to embrace robots, too. The Times says Amazon knows it looks bad: — It reported that the documents suggest the company seeks to offset PR concerns by supporting community programs like Toys for Tots, and that executives were told to avoid terms like “automation” and urged to call robots “cobots” to underscore collaboration with humans. But… — Amazon told the New York Times that the docs don’t reflect its larger hiring vision. The company denied to the outlet that there’s a connection between its community involvement and automation and that it instructs execs to avoid automation language. One Amazon executive said that the company uses savings from automation to expand hiring elsewhere. —SK",2025-10-22 10:39:06
19a0b53c4df59d67_7,Fake meat on a very real stock rally,"Reddit investors are still chasing the high of locking in and driving up GameStop stock four years ago. This time, their meme stock of choice is Beyond Meat. The company behind the plant-based meat you briefly glance at before settling for cheaper ground chuck is the focus of another social-media-driven short squeeze that has helped push the stock up ~250% this week, alongside news of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart. The stock pop was spurred by Dubai-based real estate developer Dimitri Semenikhin, who goes by Capybara Stocks on social media. His original Reddit post hyping up Beyond Meat was removed, but he told Business Insider that he bought 4% of its stock and concluded that the company’s most recent debt deal could be a better sign than most investors thought: • Last week, Beyond completed a convertible debt swap that quadrupled its share count, resulting in a significant drop in share price from just above $2 to around 50 cents per share. • The stock closed at $3.62 per share yesterday. Big picture: — The rally came after years of Beyond losing steam. The company led a fake meat revolution to its 2019 IPO, wielding a $230 price per share, before the entire market seemed to stagnate as consumers lost their appetite for alternative protein.— MM",2025-10-22 10:39:06

19a06216285c3655_2,You’ve probably heard…,"Yesterday was a great day for anyone trying to finish their laundry on company time, but a frustrating one if you were trying to do pretty much anything else. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was down, with rippling outages rolling through nearly a third of the internet and affecting thousands of businesses around the globe. In the evening, about 15 hours after the trouble began, Amazon said it had “returned to normal operations.” What happened? — Around 3am ET, outage reports started cropping up. Amazon blamed an error in the DNS system, which does the actual connecting to the site when a user clicks on a link or app. The error came after Amazon pushed a technical update to a database service. Because AWS undergirds ~30% of the web, the problem had a global impact. Millions of people got error messages Even as Amazon said it was starting to get things patched up in the morning, the AWS outage continued, peaking around midday, according to Down Detector. Spinning pinwheels: — Banks and financial services apps like Venmo and Robinhood weren’t working. Streaming and gaming sites like HBO Max, Tidal, Roblox, and Fortnite struggled. The Snapchat app was no use all day, and even Wordle wasn’t available. Amazon also felt the pain: • Its own e-commerce site and services like Ring and Alexa were reported to be offline. • Early estimates for how much this outage is going to cost top out around $75 million per hour —with $72 million per hour coming from Amazon itself while its site was down, according to the UK-based UX design firm Tenscope (though AWS generated $107.6 billion in revenue last year, so it can likely afford the hit). Time to say “we told you so.” — Experts are using this massive disruption to point out that this is what happens when most of the internet relies on a few major providers. AWS only has two main competitors: Microsoft’s Azure and Google’s Cloud Platform, so if any of them have even a slight hiccup, it becomes everyone’s problem. And it’s not an easy problem to solve, as very few companies could build the infrastructure it takes to power even a fraction of what AWS handles. —MM",2025-10-21 10:27:05

Shares of Apple climbed nearly 4% to close at ~$262, surpassing the company’s previous all-time high of $259 from last December: • Over the weekend, Counterpoint Research reported that the iPhone 17 lineup outsold the iPhone 16 lineup by 14% in the US and China during its first 10 days in each market. • Yesterday, Loop Capital upgraded Apple from a “hold” to a “buy,” and pumped its price target from $226 to $315. The day before, Evercore ISI re-added $AAPL to its “Tactical Outperform List” after removing it in early 2024 over soft revenue projections.

But the Star-Spangled Banner’s lunar ETA keeps going up: • SpaceX’s work-in-progress Starship exploded in three of the last five test flights. • Critics also blame deadline slippage on SpaceX’s experimental flight plan—which includes refueling Starship during midflight and a risky lunar landing of a 165-foot rocket. Looking ahead… — Some former NASA officials say they don’t expect Space X to be ready for Artemis III before 2032, according to the New York Times. —SK",2025-10-21 10:27:05
19a06216285c3655_8,Prime number: 60k peanut allergies avoided,"Peanuts may still be treated like Public Enemy No. 1 at elementary schools, but updated medical guidelines that recommended feeding the legume to children when they’re young has significantly reduced potentially life-threatening peanut allergies. A new study published yesterday in the journal Pediatrics found ~60,000 kids were spared developing a peanut allergy since guidance was issued in 2015 telling parents to introduce the food to babies as young as 4 months. Doctors had previously advised against giving peanuts to children before they turned 3 years old. But according to the study: • Peanut allergies in children aged 0–3 fell by 27% after parents of high-risk children were given the new guidance in 2015. • These allergies dropped by more than 40% when those guidelines were broadened to all kids in 2017. • Since then, eggs replaced peanuts as the most common allergy in children. “I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn’t implemented this public health effort,” Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s Dr. David Hill, who authored the study, told the Associated Press. It’s also been a boon to parents who can’t come up with anything more creative than PB&J for lunch. —AR",2025-10-21 10:27:05

19a0111b63c7bd06_2,Walmart is adding malls to its cart,"While Americans are buying trash bags and Great Value soda at Walmart, Walmart is buying…malls. The big-box colossus just snagged a Norwalk, CT, retail plaza for $44.5 million, beating out a “substantial” amount of interest in the space by laying out the juiciest offer, according to Jeff Kintzer, a principal at Royal Properties, which represented the seller. A Walmart store anchors the shopping center, so the chain moving from lessee to owner doesn’t inspire much intrigue by itself. As the New York Times reported, Walmart already owns most of its locations. But the deal is part of an emerging pattern: • In May, Walmart bought another shopping center in Bethel Park, PA, where it was also the anchor tenant. • Perhaps most interestingly, Walmart bought a different Pennsylvania mall in January—where it had no retail presence. Monroeville Mall (Walmart’s Version) Walmart purchased the Monroeville Mall in Western Pennsylvania for $34 million. Perhaps coincidentally, it wanted a store in the town of Monroeville 20 years ago, but got denied by local authorities. In what might be a revenge move a la Taylor Swift, Walmart buying the mall can clear the pathway into the market far more easily than getting approvals and building a site from scratch. The chain has not commented on its plans in Monroeville, but it applied for a $7.5 million redevelopment grant from the state of Pennsylvania to support the “full demolition” of the mall and to build new retail, restaurant, and entertainment venues. What in the (Wally) world? — In 2018, Walmart publicly announced a plan to reimagine spaces around its stores as “town centers” that could include local food vendors, gyms, and recreation centers. The Monroeville acquisition might be part of that. Who among us is not a little behind on our New Year’s resolutions?— HVL",2025-10-20 10:53:11

199f6c5930762c4f_2,Credit drama sends banks reeling,"Investors around the world are side-eyeing US financial institutions after claims of questionable corporate lending came to light. Two regional banks are accusing investment funds tied to the firm Cantor Fitzgerald of fraudulently taking out multimillion-dollar loans to buy distressed commercial mortgage loans, the banks disclosed this week. Salt Lake City-based Zions Bancorp is suing to recover more than $60 million, and Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp is trying to get back ~$100 million. The people running the Cantor funds ​​“vehemently deny” the allegations, their lawyer said. Teed up for panic Regarding loan quality, Wall Street was already feeling as nervous as a dress code misinterpreter after suspicions of loan fraud arose earlier this week against bankrupt auto supplier First Brands. Then, Zions’s announcement triggered a widespread crisis of confidence in US credit lending. Bloomberg reports that on Thursday: • Zions and Western Alliance led all US regional banks but one—the aptly named Triumph Bank—into the red. • In the big leagues, 74 of the largest US banks collectively lost more than $100 billion in market value. Internationally, Europe’s index of 600 major banks took its biggest spill since Aug. 1, and Asian bank stocks also stumbled yesterday. But in the US, a fresh slate of strong earnings reports from regional banks helped the American sector regain ground during yesterday’s trading session. Jamie Dimon, lowkey psychic: — “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” the JPMorgan CEO said on Tuesday regarding the collapse of First Brands and the earlier bankruptcy of auto lender Tricolor…but his words also could have led people to more closely monitor disclosures and to look for holes in the less well-regulated private credit market this week. Big picture: — Bankers, executives, and analysts insist that the tree isn’t rotten—just a few bad apples that seem to be falling at once. Another reassuring sign is that several major banks aren’t ramping up their provisions, aka emergency funds, which suggests that they’re not bracing for a crisis. Still, there is an element of “smile and wave, boys” afoot: “Perception sometimes becomes reality or it mirrors reality,” Wells Fargo analyst Timur Braziler told the Wall Street Journal. —ML",2025-10-18 10:53:05

It will start giving their estates the ability to opt out of likenesses being used on the app. Other families have also had AI-related complaints: • Zelda Williams, daughter of late comedian Robin Williams, asked fans to stop sending her AI videos of her father. • George Carlin, whose estate once sued a podcast for using an AI-generated version of the comedian, has also appeared in videos made using Sora that his daughter called “depressing.” Sora has other issues: — After backlash, OpenAI also recently announced plans to give copyright holders more control over how their content appears in Sora.— BC",2025-10-18 10:53:05

199f1922a6864b31_2,It may be harder to get a holiday gig this year,"Aspiring mall santas might want to work on honing their ho-ho-hos, because this year’s holiday job market is looking a lot more cutthroat. Indeed searches for seasonal holiday positions jumped 27% from last year and were 50% above 2023 levels as of late September, according to a report the job site released yesterday. Meanwhile, openings grew only modestly: • Holiday job listings for roles like cashier and seasonal associate rose just 2.7% from 2024, suggesting that competition might be more intense than in years past. • While holiday openings are up from 2024, they are below their 2023 levels and lower than what was typical pre-pandemic. Analysts say job seekers applying for holiday work earlier in the fall is likely due to a slowing hiring market. There might be more people looking to get paid directing customers to the ugly sweater aisle, with the US losing 32,000 private sector jobs last month, per ADP’s payroll data. There’s even grimmer projections The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas expects retail holiday hiring to fall 8% from last year, possibly hitting its lowest level since 2009, when the global financial crisis made the season not so merry. The company said that looming tariffs, inflation, and an embrace of automation might be making employers less inclined to hire during the holidays. Holiday employment heavyweights UPS and FedEx have yet to release hiring goals for this season, while Target emphasized its plans to rely on existing workers. Amazon said it plans to onboard 250,000 additional workers to help with the holiday rush, matching its hiring spree from last year. Big picture: — Gift sellers might be more reluctant to splurge on hiring this year, as they’re not optimistic about their cash haul during the festive weeks. The National Retail Federation expects an average holiday shopper to spend 1.3% less than last year. —SK",2025-10-17 10:39:07

As part of a pilot program, US-based drivers who opt in will be able to earn extra money (the amount depends on the complexity) on their phones between trips by: • Recording audio in certain languages or accents. • Entering documents in different languages (The Verge reports uploading a menu is worth as much as $1). • Submitting specific photos. Are drivers training their replacements? — This new program is in support of Uber AI Solutions, which recently expanded its data-labeling business by purchasing Segments.ai, a Belgian startup that uses information gathered from cameras and sensors to enable autonomous driving. However, an Uber spokesperson said the data obtained from driver tasks will not be used to develop driverless vehicles.

And hello to Erebor, a new crypto-focused US bank that received initial federal approval this week, teeing it up to fill a financing gap left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other tech lenders in 2023. Erebor—named after a mountain from JRR Tolkien’s universe where a dragon guarded immeasurable riches—was co-founded earlier this year by Palmer Luckey: • That’s the guy with a soul patch and mullet who runs the weapons manufacturer Anduril , which is also the name of Aragorn’s sword from The Lord of the Rings . • Erebor investors include Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, co-founders of Palantir , the oft-protested software company that…also gets its name from the Tolkien franchise. Luckey’s new venture will offer traditional and crypto-oriented banking to upstart tech companies and the ultrawealthy, according to its charter application and approval letter. It needs another stamp of approval from more federal officials before operations can commence, but road bumps are unlikely under President Trump’s crypto-friendly administration. “Palmer’s political network will get this done,” — an Erebor fundraising memo promised earlier this year. Luckey, Lonsdale, and Thiel are longtime Trump backers, and an attorney who helped them draft Erebor’s charter application is now chief counsel to the federal official who just granted the bank’s preliminary approval. —ML",2025-10-17 10:39:07

Some title refactors are simple name changes, while others are signals that a company is taking an opinionated view of the world.

199ec7bb86c15528_2,"Big banks are doing very, very well right now","If you see an investment banker on the street, they’ll likely be sporting a smile bigger than when they got to pick The Wolf of Wall Street for the Christmas Day movie. The biggest banks in the US have reported stellar earnings over the last few days, crushing analyst expectations and painting a bullish picture of the economy. DEALS, DEALS, DEALS. — Among the banks to report boffo quarterly results this week, Goldman Sachs said a surge in dealmaking has supercharged the industry, which is apparent in the gangbusters numbers major banks have delivered: • Goldman said its third-quarter profits jumped 37% to $4.1 billion, putting its main investment arm on track to deliver its best year ever (though the bank also announced an upcoming round of layoffs). • Citigroup’s profits were up 16% from a year ago, JPMorgan Chase reported a 12% jump, and Bank of America was up 23% YoY. Morgan Stanley shot past expectations with a 45% jump in profits from last year, with its quarterly trading revenue even higher than rival Goldman’s. But…money is really only moving around at the top The health of big banks is often seen as a signal for the whole economy, but there’s a catch to all this good news. While corporate dealmaking and investments ratcheted up this summer, spending at the bottom seemed to freeze, with consumer deposits growing, but consumer lending demand staying in a holding pattern. The trend mirrors Fed data released last month, which showed that the top 10% of US consumers made up nearly half of total consumer spending earlier this year. Looking ahead… — there’s a chance the good times won’t keep rolling for these banking giants. Concerns about the private credit market have been growing after the collapse of wildly indebted auto lender Tricolor and car part supplier First Brands. Plus, industry vets like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have warned that market valuations are nearing “bubble territory.” Journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, who specializes in market crashes, said he’s nervous about unsustainable stock prices.— MM",2025-10-16 10:53:07

The court’s conservative majority questioned whether using race as a factor in determining Congressional districts, which the law permits to remedy the suppression of Black voters, should have an end point in time. If the court finds that it should, the change could help Republicans win more seats in Congress.

199ec7bb86c15528_6,Media rejects Pentagon reporting restrictions en masse,"Starting yesterday, a more restrictive media policy from the Pentagon went into effect that was almost universally rejected by news organizations, which said it would cost reporters their First Amendment protections and criminalize them for doing their jobs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revoked access to the Pentagon building for journalists who refused to sign a pledge to not solicit and publish information from the Defense Department. Under the new rules, even if intelligence is unclassified, reporters could be deemed a “security risk.” At least 30 news organizations refused to sign on, including major TV networks NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, and Fox, as well as print outlets like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Only the right-wing One America News Network agreed to abide by the new policy, while even other conservative outlets like Newsmax balked. Impacted journalists turned in their press passes yesterday. Murky legal ground: — According to a lawyer who spoke to Reuters, any reporters who acknowledge the new policy and later disclose sensitive information could be more susceptible to prosecution. The Pentagon Press Association, which represents news organizations that cover the military, said the policy “threatens retaliation” against reporters. Here to stay: — President Trump backed the new approach on Tuesday, saying Hegseth, who Trump supported when he leaked military plans in a group chat, “finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace and maybe security for our nation.” —DL",2025-10-16 10:53:07
199ec7bb86c15528_7,Snack dupe puts Trader Joe’s in a jam,"With a name like Smucker’s, its lawsuit has to be good. The company that’s synonymous with grape jelly sued Trader Joe’s this week for allegedly copying one of its most successful products, the Uncrustables sandwich. Peanut butter and subterfuge. — The Smucker’s lawsuit accuses Trader Joe’s of intentionally confusing customers and risking its brand value by knocking off the look and packaging of Uncrustables: • Smucker’s has a trademark for “a round pie-like shape with distinct peripheral undulated crimping,” and for its boxes that show said sandwich with a bite taken out, the Washington Post reported . • The company has invested a lot in Uncrustables, spending $1 billion to develop and market the signature snack over the past 20 years, according to the lawsuit. Smucker’s wants Trader Joe’s—which hasn’t commented to news outlets about the suit—to destroy its frozen, crustless, PB&J bread pockets and hand over the money it made from them since launching this summer (plus damages). Alleged dupes are typical for TJ’s — (see: Oreos Joe-Joe’s, Cheerios Joe’s O’s, and Pringles Saddle Potato Crisps), but it may have traded too close to the Joe this time. Smucker’s noted that there are other Uncrustable competitors it hasn’t gone after—likely a reference to Walmart, Aldi, and Target, which depict clearly square-shaped dupes without a rounded bite on their boxes. —ML",2025-10-16 10:53:07

London police have recently launched a crackdown after 80,000 phones were nicked in the British capital last year, the New York Times reports. Those pilfered phones aren’t just being nabbed by small-time crooks—they’re often being handed over to international criminal networks that send many of them to China for resale. According to the NYT: • Two weeks of raids last month on suspected middlemen yielded 2,000 stolen phones and ~$266,000 in cash. • A pair of men arrested last month were accused of being ringleaders of a group that sent as many as 40,000 stolen phones to China. Police say their car had phones wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent the transmission of tracking signals—and that they were spotted buying nearly 1.5 miles’ worth of foil at Costco. British authorities say that one reason phones are so frequently targeted is that, in this case, crime pays. Thieves can unload them in the UK for ~$400 each—more than three times the pay for a full day of work at minimum wage—and newer phone models can fetch as much as $5,000 in China. —AR",2025-10-16 10:53:07

199e754172cddc84_2,You can’t even watchStep Brotherson Teen Instagram,"Instagram announced yesterday that it’s rolling out new teen user protections that mirror the rules governing movie ratings, and that teen accounts will be limited to seeing content that is PG-13. So, keep it clean, folks: Using more than one f-bomb could now get you booted from the teens’ feeds. How we got here: — Facing backlash over how kids interact with its platforms, Meta started automatically making any Instagram account set up by someone under the age of 18 a “Teen Account” last year. This sets the account to private, pauses notifications from 10pm to 7am, and limits what kind of content can be seen in Reels or on the Explore page. The new restrictions will further constrain what content teens can access: • They will block entire accounts that post 18+ content, such as drugs, sex, and maybe even rock ’n’ roll, from teens’ view, and prevent teen users from following handles that have inappropriate usernames or links in bios directing people to sites like OnlyFans or liquor stores. • The new rules will apply even in cases where teens have already been following an “adult” account (they won’t be able to view the offending content anymore). • The change will also bar teens from seeing search results for things like “gore” and “alcohol.” The bots have to follow the rules too This is the first safety update that Meta has implemented for the AI chatbots that Instagram recently introduced. A report from Reuters released in August found that Meta’s AI rules let these bots have “sensual” DMs with minors. The new rules say these chats won’t go past PG-13 topics with users under 18. Big picture: — Tech companies have been bombarded with public and political pressure to address the unsavory content they seem to be feeding underage users for as long as you could set your relationship status to “it’s complicated” for attention. Spotify also announced new parental controls in its app yesterday, and Sam Altman provided an update on ChatGPT: Now that it’s implemented age-gating, the chatbot is ready to go full-steam-ahead on erotica for adults only in December.— MM",2025-10-15 10:52:56

199e754172cddc84_6,Attention couch potatoes: Furniture tariffs are here,"For once, it’s worth listening to tariff commentary from armchair experts—specifically, when it comes to the import duties on furniture and wood entering the US that went into effect yesterday. Importers will now pay a 10% tariff on softwood lumber and timber, which largely come from Canada. There’s also a new 25% duty on kitchen cabinets, vanities, and upholstered wooden furniture. Cabinet and vanity tariffs will rise to 50% on Jan. 1, while furniture tariffs will go to 30%. Close to home The Trump administration says the tariffs are a boon to US manufacturers in former furniture-making hubs like North Carolina, which have struggled to compete with cheaper foreign furniture. But: • Experts say that, while taxing furniture imports could help some domestic manufacturers compete, American retailers and furniture-makers importing components might face higher costs, forcing them to raise prices. • Some industry insiders expect the tariffs to affect selection more than prices, as furniture sellers might limit their imported offerings to the highest-margin products. Meanwhile, economists worry that taxing imports of products used to build and furnish houses could further slow homebuying and home improvement, which have already been hit by elevated interest rates. The ships carrying couches… — are also caught in the trade war, after the US and China started charging each other’s ships port fees yesterday.

The government seized about $15 billion worth of the digital currency from wallets registered to a business owner it claims was running a massive “pig butchering” fraud ring. The DOJ called it the largest forfeiture operation in its history. Despite the name, “pig butchering” involves no actual pork chops, just making an emotional connection to the victim to metaphorically fatten them up for slaughter (which, in more literal terms, is just taking their money): • The DOJ is accusing Chen Zhi, the founder and head of the Cambodia-based multinational conglomerate Prince Holding Group, of actually heading up an international criminal operation that has caused “billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world.” • The Treasury Department also designated Prince as a criminal organization that US companies can’t do business with. • In an indictment filed in New York, prosecutors allege that the company trafficked people into forced labor and made them engage in scams where the victims handed over crypto they were falsely promised would be invested. Although the DOJ has the bitcoin, Chen remains at large. —AR",2025-10-15 10:52:56

199e21d51bd5e158_2,This company supplies car parts & 2008 flashbacks,"The finance world is on edge because of an auto supplier that you’ve probably never heard of: First Brands, a midsize maker of spark plugs and other automotive accoutrement, is in the midst of a multibillion-dollar meltdown. Weeks after declaring bankruptcy, the company’s founder and CEO resigned yesterday amid suspicions around its accounting practices. ICYMI: — First Brands filed for bankruptcy late last month, revealing more than $10 billion in debt from loans that it took out over the past decade to fund ambitious acquisitions and expand quickly across five continents. But the company suddenly ran out of money, and now Wall Street financiers are clutching their IOUs: • The investment bank Jefferies appears to be the most exposed. Its stock fell last week after it announced that one of its subsidiaries lent First Brands $715 million. • Funds run by other major firms, including UBS and BlackRock, are also owed hefty checks that likely aren’t coming any time soon. With as much as $2.3 billion in assets unaccounted for, federal officials are now investigating what exactly went wrong at First Brands. According to court filings, part of the problem was that the company would pledge the same invoiced revenues to several of its lenders, like when you promise your last slice of pizza to both your partner and your roommate. Alarms sound in the private credit sector Many of the companies that lent money to First Brands aren’t traditional banks, meaning their financing falls into the far less regulated world of private credit —a $3 trillion market that exploded after banks got more cautious with loans following the 2008 financial crisis. Since private credit deals are often complex and inked off the public markets, “if something is going disastrously wrong, it might only be detected once it’s too late,” per Politico. Zoom out: — First Brands’ bankruptcy isn’t expected to be market-shattering, but some analysts think it suggests a growing risk that private credit-related collapses could ripple out into broader financial trouble. —ML",2025-10-14 10:39:29

199e21d51bd5e158_6,Paris preps tomatoes for Shein boutique,"Shein’s brick-and-mortar debut in Paris has inspired the biggest French backlash since the American tourist who asked for barbecue sauce with his steak au poivre. The Chinese e-commerce giant's boutique opening inside the historic BHV Marais department store next month is drawing outrage from French fashion brands and unions, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, and over 100,000 petitioners. Detractors argue Shein’s business model of purveying cheap made-in-China clothes undercuts local competition, harms the environment, and is built on labor abuses. Shein maintains it wants to adapt its production to European requirements. Shein shaming The Shein boutique hasn’t yet arrived at BHV Marais, but the company that operates the couture emporium, Société des Grands Magasins (SGM), is already getting dinged: • Several brands who would have to share square footage with Shein are pulling their merchandise from the store in protest. Sheingate comes as many brands are already displeased with SGM over delayed payments for their wares. • A state-owned bank nixed plans to finance SGM’s purchase of the BHV building over the Shein deal. Meanwhile, SGM has plans for several other Shein boutiques inside stores it operates in multiple French cities.

The shutdown has already led to flight delays, national park closures, and IRS phone lines going down. And as more employees don’t see a paycheck (and more get laid off), it could dent consumer spending, which drives the bulk of economic growth. Neither Democrats nor Republicans seem to be in a rush to resolve this. Dreamforce starts today. — Salesforce begins its annual takeover of San Francisco today with its massive Dreamforce conference. More than 50,000 people who definitely know what Salesforce does will descend on the city to hear CEO Marc Benioff give a keynote address on what he calls agentic enterprise, a new corporate model in which AI and humans collaborate. But some political comments Benioff made ahead of the conference may overshadow this business push: In an interview with the New York Times last weekend, the longtime liberal called on President Trump to deploy National Guard troops to San Francisco, saying that Democrats had “destroyed” the city. Earnings season kicks off. — It’s the most wonderful time of the year. No, not the winter holidays, but Q3 earnings season, which starts this week.

199d2b94feaa535e_2,US-China beef escalates—again,"After weeks of diffusing trade tensions, the US and China have resumed throwing punches. Yesterday, President Trump announced a 100% additional tariff on Chinese goods and export restrictions on “all critical software” on Nov. 1—a response to China going gloves off by imposing unprecedentedly strict export controls on rare earth metals this week. He also said there’s “no reason” for him to meet China’s leader Xi Jinping two weeks ahead of their planned tete-a-tete. Why is Trump so mad? • Under regulations announced Thursday, China will require foreign companies producing goods containing Chinese rare earths to get approval from Chinese authorities to export them. • Trump said that China is exploiting its “monopoly” power on rare earths, a group of 17 metals integral to tech like missiles, smartphone chips, and EV batteries. Tough before talks: — This move came despite the US and China agreeing in June on the outline of a deal that included loosening rare earths export restrictions. By throttling the supply of vital tech used by American companies, including US military contractors, experts say China is trying to get leverage in trade negotiations with Trump. China also took other muscle-flexing actions this week, like opening an antitrust probe of American chipmaker Qualcomm’s recent acquisition of Israeli semiconductor firm Autotalks. China’s trump card Rare earths aren’t actually…rare, since many countries, including the US, have deposits. But China controls around 60% of rare earths mining—a process that comes with heavy environmental costs—and over 90% of processing, according to the International Energy Agency. It’s not just a problem for the US: — Foreign companies that export products containing Chinese rare earths are caught in the crossfire. Germany said it’s working with the EU to boost rare earths production in Europe. As the stock market flashed red… — investors piled into safe haven assets like US government bonds and gold, as well as shares of US-based rare earths producers, sending their stocks surging. —SK",2025-10-11 10:53:18

We don’t need no stinking badges: — Though the bank initially called it voluntary, biometric access is now “required” to get into the skyscraper at 270 Park Avenue, according to the FT, which cited internal communications. That means that instead of scanning badges, employees will have to take a more hands-on approach, offering up their palms or fingerprints. Ocular scans are also possible, so building access could be denied in the blink of an eye. The stricter measures come on the heels of a deadly shooting in July at a nearby building that houses the NFL headquarters and other offices.

199cd85aaeffebfd_2,Is there an AI bubble or not?,"The only thing more mainstream than trashing Taylor Swift’s latest album is saying that AI is a bubble. The International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England joined a choir of financial institutions this week sounding a bearish alarm, warning that the global economy will suffer if optimism about AI fades and the markets currently carried by AI investments crash. Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that even though he believes benefits from the tech are real, many investors will lose money, with the market underappreciating the risk of a downturn. But the anxieties are far from consensus opinion on Wall Street, with several banks releasing research this week suggesting that “bubble” might be a misnomer. Banks say: not quite a bubble Goldman Sachs said that, despite an outsize share of the global stock market’s value coming from only a handful of companies pumping billions into AI (which it acknowledged is unsustainable), Big Tech’s earnings are growing at a strong pace. The bank also noted that AI players are largely using their own massive cash piles to finance AI infrastructure, rather than relying on debt. Similarly: • Morgan Stanley pointed out that S&P 500 companies are generating three times the cash flow as a share of their valuations as they were in the lead-up to the dot-com bubble bursting in 2000. • Bank of America said that so-called circular deals—like the one in which OpenAI recently received a $100 billion investment from Nvidia, which it’ll use to buy Nvidia’s chips—account for a fraction of AI funding But even if it’s revolutionary… — AI can still lead to a market crash, with Bain and Company estimating that annual revenue from the technology would have to be $2 trillion by 2030 to justify all the investment. And skeptics point out that, unlike with overinvestment in railroads and fiber-optic cables that underpinned previous bubbles but still led to productivity growth down the road, the costly AI chips running data centers need to be replaced every few years. —SK",2025-10-10 10:39:18

The main disappointment: — For 2030, Ferrari lifted its revenue projection to $10.4 billion, missing Wall Street’s target of $11.3 billion, per a FactSet poll. • On top of this, the luxury auto company implied that its adjusted earnings will grow 6% annually through 2030, down from the 10% rate it projected three years ago for 2022 through 2026, according to RBC Capital. • Ferrari’s update dragged its stock down 15%, tipping its year-to-date market performance into the red. This overshadowed what was supposed to be an exciting moment for Ferrari: — the partial unveiling of its first all-electric car, the Elettrica, which iPhone designer Jony Ive helped out on.

Lay’s promises that the baked, kettle-cooked, and original chips won’t taste different, they just won’t have any synthetic colors or flavors: • The redesign will also incorporate a new logo that looks like the sun, photos of potatoes on the bag, and the phrase “Made with real potatoes.” • A 2021 survey found that 42% of consumers didn’t know Lay’s were made out of the spuds. • The changes come as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushes companies to ditch artificial ingredients. Big picture: — Lay’s generates about 60% of PepsiCo’s annual sales but has seen sales slip every quarter for the last three years. Consumers in every income bracket have been ditching classic snack brands amid rising prices. —MM",2025-10-10 10:39:18

199c86d434d67389_2,The government shutdown might delay your flight,"The only things reliably taking off at airports this week are flight delay times. Travelers are beginning to feel the effects of the ongoing government shutdown as air traffic controllers—who are being asked to work without pay—use their sick leave instead of coming to work. Staffing shortages have created havoc at more than a dozen airports this week: • FlightAware, the flight tracking website you only use if your flight is disrupted, reported more than 6,150 delays of flights involving the US on Monday, more than 3,800 on Tuesday, and thousands more yesterday, although some could be attributed to poor weather. • Burbank had zero available air traffic controllers for more than five hours on Monday, while Nashville reported the first full ground stop due to the shutdown on Tuesday. Things are probably going to get worse Unlike many government employees who are furloughed during the shutdown, air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers. That means they’re deemed essential enough to continue working, but not essential enough to get paid while the government is closed. That’s leaving some to use sick days to work a side gig , like driving for Uber, that results in earning actual money (allegedly, we’re not rats). While it’s illegal for air traffic controllers to coordinate absences — as a form of protest, even a handful of people missing work of their own volition can widen cracks in a fragile system. And there’s already a shortage of air traffic controllers, forcing them to work a grueling schedule. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said some of its members were working 10 hours per day, six days a week before the shutdown. TSA agents have also historically called out during shutdowns, potentially adding to delays. It could make a difference: — Absences from air traffic controllers and TSA security agents during the last shutdown in 2019 were one reason why it ended after 35 days. But the present shutdown, now in its ninth day, currently has no end in sight. —DL",2025-10-09 10:52:59

WNBA players and leadership have until Oct. 31 to shake hands on a new collective bargaining agreement, as the union asks for a bigger cut of the league’s growing revenue. Tensions bubbled over last week, — when the Minnesota Lynx’s Napheesa Collier, this year’s All-Star Game MVP, said the WNBA has “the worst leadership in the world.” She also claimed that WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told her in a private conversation that Caitlin Clark—whose first-year salary was $76,535—should be “grateful” for the platform the league provides her, which Engelbert has denied. What players want: — A roughly 50/50 revenue split with the league, like in the NBA (and NFL, NHL, and MLB): • Under the current bargaining agreement, WNBA players only get 9.3% of the pie, according to MarketWatch. And individual player salaries max out at $250,000 a year. • WNBA leadership long justified this relatively low pay as a result of low revenue, but players and some observers are calling foul now that viewership, ticket sales, brand sponsorships , and multibillion-dollar broadcast partnerships are booming. Looking ahead… — next year’s WNBA season could get delayed or canceled if there’s no deal by Halloween. Adam Silver, commissioner of the NBA (which oversees the WNBA), said earlier this week that he’s confident an agreement will be reached. —ML",2025-10-09 10:52:59

A new focus challenge called “ The Great Lock In ” kicked off on September 1 and promises to help you achieve your goals. What is it? — Influencers trying to run a marathon, grow their online presence, and build up their emergency funds are deeming the last 121 days of the year the perfect time to lock in, meaning to focus intensely on something, and get stuff done. The “challenge” is vague and pretty flexible, but it’s basically to adopt a pre-New Year’s resolution. Locking in resembles previous stricter social media routine rewires, like 75 Hard (a total schedule overhaul with a strict diet), or last year’s Winter Arc trend, which fitness brands like Gymshark hyped up. At least this time, no one is saying their hair is distracting them from working out for three months. Big picture: — Routines to self-optimize and help you get through seasonal changes pop up every year, but this year, many young people are turning to one as they muscle through an especially precarious economic moment. The job market in general is bleak, and recent college graduates aged 22 to 27 are facing unemployment rates at 4.8%—higher than the overall unemployment rate of 4%, according to the most recent data from the NY Fed.— MM",2025-10-09 10:52:59

As a player, Ronaldo earned $550 million in salary between 2002 and 2023 before transferring to Al-Nassr, where his $200 million annual pay isn’t taxed (which has been a problem for him in the past). Messi has made $600 million in pre-tax salary, and his current deal with Inter Miami of MLS includes a revenue-sharing agreement with Apple.

199c339aeeee1969_2,Economic turbulence propels gold to record $4k,"Investors are doing the equivalent of a toddler retreating from the playground to sit in their mom’s lap: buying up gold. The metal’s futures rallied past $4,000 per ounce yesterday for the first time , which analysts say reflects the market’s appetite for safe haven assets amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical risks. The precious metal is up by more than 50% since the beginning of the year, putting it on pace for its best year since 1979. Running on chaos World events in recent days have exacerbated concerns about governments’ ability to ensure economic stability, boosting the luster of precious metals. That comes at the expense of currency and traditional assets like stocks and bonds: • The US government has been shut down since Oct. 1 due to a Congressional budget fight, creating uncertain vibes that are heightened by delays in the release of crucial economic data. • Earlier this week, France’s prime minister resigned after just 26 days on the job, hamstringing efforts to pass a debt-curbing budget and jolting the euro. • Japanese bonds and the yen dipped this week after Sanae Takaichi, a proponent of increased government spending, emerged as the likely next prime minister, furthering concerns about the country’s debt. Who’s buying gold? Central banks have stockpiled bullion for months, while investors hoover up gold ETFs as a hedge against economic turmoil created by tariff wars and the geopolitical instability. Plus, declining interest rates are lowering the returns on bonds, prompting wealth holders to seek alternative avenues for growing their piggy banks. Billionaire Ken Griffin said that the gold rush is a concerning sign that investors see it as a safer asset than the greenback. Celebrity hedge fund manager Ray Dalio recommended that investors allocate 15% of their portfolio to gold to hedge against dollar devaluation and a potential stock market downturn. Another alternative asset — that’s been soaring is bitcoin, which passed a record $125,000 this week. —SK",2025-10-08 10:39:09

The deal values the company that lets you make money on a pope’s death at $8 billion. A new landscape for prediction markets In 2022, Polymarket was banished offshore and required to block US traders by federal regulators as part of a settlement for operating without Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) registration. But the crypto-friendly Trump administration has proven more welcoming: • In July, the DOJ and the CFTC ended two probes into Polymarket without bringing charges. Not long after, Polymarket purchased the derivatives exchange QCX, which allowed it to return (legally) to US markets. • In August, Polymarket received financial backing from Donald Trump Jr.’s venture capital firm, 1789 Capital. The president’s son also joined the company’s advisory board (he is also an advisor for rival Kalshi). Polymarket and Kalshi both added sports-related prediction markets this year that circumvent sports-betting laws in all 50 states—with the tacit approval of the White House. That’s led to a sharp uptick in trade activity for both companies.

199c339aeeee1969_7,The jingles will be quieter in Cali,"California TV watchers will no longer be startled awake by blaring cheery voice-overs as they doze off during their Futurama rewatch. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law this week that will require streaming advertisements to have the same audio level as the shows they interrupt. Starting in July, the volume level of ads on streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max must match that of the content—meaning no more deafening jolts about moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The rule is based on a similar US federal law that only covered ads on traditional TV, not streaming, which was passed in December 2010. That year, the FCC received over 130,000 complaints, mainly about loud commercials. California’s new ad volume controls were written by State Senator Tom Umberg but inspired by his legislative director, who was frustrated with streaming ads waking up his newborn daughter, Samantha. So thank you, Samantha.

Under the deal’s terms: • OpenAI will buy enough AMD chips over the next several years to generate six gigawatts of power in a bid to boost its computing capacity for ChatGPT. (For context, that’s about as much energy as 5 million US households use in a year, according to The Guardian). • The two companies’ fates may intertwine—OpenAI will obtain the rights to buy ~10% of AMD for 1 cent per share if OpenAI hits certain milestones and if AMD’s stock price rises. The deal will generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD over the next five years, CEO Lisa Su said. This also bestows some street cred upon AMD, which has lagged behind Nvidia in the advanced AI space. Its stock popped ~24% yesterday. So, what’s the problem? Similar to Carrie Bradshaw buying designer shoes on a columnist’s salary, it’s unclear how OpenAI is paying for all this. In the first half of this year, the mega startup logged $4.3 billion in revenue, but lost $2.5 billion, The Information reported. And the deal with AMD comes weeks after OpenAI said it would invest $300 billion to purchase 4.5 gigawatts of cloud computing power from software giant Oracle. OpenAI also inked a multibillion-dollar agreement with Nvidia last month for the king chipmaker to invest $100 billion in OpenAI over the next decade.

And in May, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that AI could wipe out half of entry-level jobs at white-collar companies within five years. • Harvard Business Review points out that this shift in hiring at professional services firms could leave companies wondering where partners, who do the less routine work now, will come from in the future. Maybe more AI is the answer: — Deloitte announced a massive deal yesterday to provide Anthropic’s Claude to more than 470,000 of its global employees over the next few months. —DL",2025-10-07 10:53:57
199be230ab2caf3e_8,Prime number: Not crafty enough,"Your Tinder date who made liking craft beer their entire personality might soon have a harder time getting their fix. Craft brewers are in trouble after the industry expanded just as consumer tastes were moving in a different direction, the New York Times reports: • Craft beer sales dipped 4% in 2024, according to a lobbying group for independent brewers. • For the first time in two decades, more breweries have closed than opened in the last year and a half. The NYT attributes the struggles of these small-scale ale makers to a supply and demand problem: There are more than 9,900 craft breweries across the US now, compared to just 4,800 ten years ago. But during that same period, Covid lockdowns that kept people out of bars and brew pubs helped hard seltzers become the drink of choice for many, while others gave up drinking alcohol altogether as new wellness habits took hold. Industry insiders told the paper that more small breweries may tap out amid these trends. —AR",2025-10-07 10:53:57

199b8e0813ecdd93_2,Is this the next leader of CBS News?,"CBS News, once home to the late Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite, is expected to announce Bari Weiss as its editor in chief today as part of a reported $150 million cash-and-stock deal in which the network will also acquire her firebrand media company, The Free Press. A bold move for legacy media The news startup Weiss co-founded just four years ago produces newsletters, podcasts, original reporting, and “sense-making” columns. CBS is 98 years old. It has bureaus around the world and hundreds of producers, journalists, and anchors. • Not just old news: — CBS still owns a couple of the most successful news shows on TV, 60 Minutes and CBS Sunday Morning , which draw millions of weekly viewers. As media experts refresh their browsers waiting for the official word to drop, some of them are also wondering if Weiss, with her relative lack of experience, is up for the job. This CV’s got no TV. — Weiss served as an opinion editor for the New York Times from 2017 to 2020. She has said she was “an intellectual diversity hire” there. She left the NYT due to what she called its “ illiberal environment .” The following year, she co-founded the Substack newsletter Common Sense, which rebranded as The Free Press in 2022. It exists to shake up mainstream media, much like this rumored deal to acquire it has. Zoom out: — When the Paramount–Skydance merger concluded in August, new CEO David Ellison said, “I do not want to politicize our company in any way, shape, or form.” Critics of Weiss and this deal say they would do precisely that. The Free Press has been called “the anti-anti-Trump publication.” Many industry watchers believe Paramount settled a lawsuit that Trump brought against CBS to get the Skydance merger over the line , as FCC approval of the deal came shortly after the settlement.— HVL",2025-10-06 10:25:25

The House will remain out of town after Speaker Mike Johnson declared Oct. 7 through Oct. 13 “a district work period” while Washington is in disarray.

Honey, I shrunk the plates: — Olive Garden started experimenting with lighter portions earlier this year as a way to offer some variety from the unlimited pasta and breadstick deals it’s known for. Customers like the new options, which have turned some diners into regulars, according to parent company Darden Restaurants. P.F. Chang’s also recently started offering smaller options, and The Cheesecake Factory added a new “Bites” concept to its phone-book-sized menu in July. They’re just following the data: • According to the National Restaurant Association, 74% of customers want smaller portions. • And 44% of adults say they order from the kids’ menu to save money and eat less, according to a survey from hospitality company Lightspeed Commerce. What’s the deal? — Besides cost savings, many customers just don’t have the appetite for a big meal because they snack a lot during the day. Maeve Webster, the president of consulting firm Menu Matters, told CNN that more people are also eating out by themselves , so family-style portions just don’t make sense. Some restaurants have also gone small to cater to customers taking GLP-1 drugs to lose weight.— BC",2025-10-06 10:25:25

The financial metric environment won’t be completely barren, though. Consumer credit data will be released on Tuesday. The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its September 17 meeting on Wednesday, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver remarks at a bank conference on Thursday. Then, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment report will be out on Friday. The US Supreme Court’s new term starts today: — The high court starts its nine-month term with plenty of big cases in the pipeline. During the term, the justices will hear arguments on the legality of many of President Trump’s tariffs, Trump’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and Trump’s removal of Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The Supreme Court will also hear cases involving gun rights, campaign finance limits, and, potentially, Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship (to name just a few). The term runs through the end of June. A smattering of sports offerings: — The NHL season opens on Tuesday, with the two-time defending champion Florida Panthers taking the ice against the Chicago Blackhawks. Then, the WNBA Finals continue on Wednesday, when the Phoenix Mercury will try to rise up against the Las Vegas Aces, who hold a 2–0 lead in the series. There’s also plenty of playoff baseball, regular season football, and NBA preseason games to go around. Everything else: • Beverages company Constellation Brands (Modelo, Corona, Pacifico, and more) reports earnings today. • OpenAI will host its annual developer conference, DevDay, today in San Francisco. • Egypt hosts negotiations between Israel and Hamas today.
